## 📊 Project Overview
This project serves as a strategic "War Room" for GlobalCharge. We utilize Machine Learning (Random Forest) and custom ROI indexing to identify resilient markets for electric vehicle infrastructure investment.

### 🧠 The Intelligence Engine
* **Dual-Classification Model:** Evaluates markets for both 'High Growth' (Takeoff) and 'Market Resilience' (Survival).
* **2024 Regime-Shift Validation:** Tested against the "Hard Mode" 2024 economic environment using temporal splits.
* **Strategic ROI Index:** A multi-factor formula weighing AI survival probability, market saturation, and purchasing power.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. **Explore Trends:** Analyze global adoption trajectories.
2. **Stress Test:** Adjust the "Risk Weight" to see how the $100M allocation shifts during a crisis.
3. **Simulate ROI:** Use custom sliders to align the portfolio with the Board's specific risk appetite.
