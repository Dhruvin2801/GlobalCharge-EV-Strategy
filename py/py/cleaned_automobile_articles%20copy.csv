The layoffs follow previous workforce reductions earlier this year at various John Deere plants, including in East Moline, Moline, and Ankeny, Iowa, impacting hundreds of employees. The company has also laid off its employees from the Waterloo plant in Iowa. The layoffs are expected to be part of John Deere's strategic move to realign its operations and enhance its positioning in the market. The company reported profits of USD 10.166 billion last year, but it has also communicated that operational costs are rising and market demand is declining, which requires organisational changes. As per a report of Fox Business, the company is set to lay off approximately 610 production workers at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa by the end of the summer. As per the report, the layoffs might include 280 employees at a plant in East Moline, Illinois, 230 workers at a factory in Davenport, Iowa, and around 100 staff members at the Dubuque, Iowa, plant.Yes Bank Layoffs: Private Sector Bank Lays Off Around 500 Employees in Cost-Cutting Move; Check Details.  The company cites a decrease in demand for its products from these specific factories as the primary reason for the job cuts. The layoffs will take effect starting from August 30. The report suggests that workers will be provided with a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit covering approximately 95% of their weekly net pay for up to 26 weeks, along with profit-sharing options and health benefits.Planet Labs Layoffs: Earth Imaging and Monitoring Company Lays Off 17% of Its Workforce, Around 180 People as Part of Cost-Cutting Measures.

The company has lowered its annual profit forecast for the second time and expects a bigger drop in sales of large agricultural equipment. In addition, there have been reports of job cuts. John Deere recently made an announcement that it will be relocating the production of skid steer loaders and compact track loaders from its Dubuque facility to Mexico by the end of 2026 to enhance their factories for upcoming products and increase its operational efficiency. . .",
India's high-speed train hopes face hurdles,"India's Vande Bharat Express, launched in 2019, aimed to revolutionise rail travel but still falls short of international high-speed standards. Trains tested at 180 km/h are limited to 160 km/h and sometimes reduced to 130 km/h due to safety concerns. Infrastructure limitations, like inadequate tracks and signalling systems, impede achieving true high-speed rail status.",https://www.thecore.in/economy/india-train-high-speed-trains-vande-bharat-558094?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle,"India has semi-high-speed trains that can potentially cut travel times substantially, but the lack of necessary allied infrastructure is holding them back. Indias tryst with high-speed trains has been in public discourse for decades. We saw some green shoots when Vande Bharat Express trains were launched in 2019. But even today, by international standards, Indias high-speed trains are semi-high speed at best, according to Sudhanshu Mani, who served as general manager at Indian Railways' Integral Coach Factory and is also credited as the mastermind behind the Vande Bharat Express train. High speed is a term loosely used, and there are various definitions ranging from speeds above 200 km/hr to above 250 km/hr, I would place it more like at least above 220 km/hr, Mani told The Core. Currently, the fastest trains in India are the Vande Bharat Express from Delhi to Varanasi and the Gatimaan Express that connects Delhi and Jhansi. These trains have been tested to run at 180 km/hr but are commercially cleared only to run at 160 km/hr.

The overall average speed of Vande Bharat trains in the country was 83 km/hr as of April last year. But whats causing trains that have been tested to run at 180 km/hr to run at much lower speeds? Its the lack of allied infrastructure and safety measures. There are two main reasons, track conditions, and signalling systems. To run at these high speeds, the rail tracks need to be upgraded and this hasnt happened at the pace expected.  Fencing of the tracks (is required), because the impact of any cattle getting run over is much higher on a higher speed. Improvement in overhead traction line is also needed, Mani said. Indias train signalling system is due for an upgrade and recent fatal accidents have further highlighted this need. Yet, the installation of Kavach, an automatic train protection (ATP) system, isn't fast-tracked. India has trains that can potentially cut travel times substantially, but the lack of necessary allied infrastructure is holding them back. Once these factors are addressed, we may have substantial kilometres being able to support the 160 km/hr speeds. In these circumstances, having trains running at 220 km/hr across the country seems a distant dream so far. One may argue why India needs such super fast in the first place. With air travel booming, it is clear that there is a need for public transport systems and fast trains are key to boosting economic growth too. However, air travel remains inaccessible for many Indians as it is expensive. Additionally, trains are considered a cleaner and greener alternative. However, travel times are the biggest challenge. The comfort of the passengers has been more or less taken care of in both of these modes of transport, according to Mani. For example, (from) Delhi to Bhopal, if you can bring it (travel time) down to, say, four and a half hours, then the advantage that air traffic has is lost, and people would prefer to travel in trains, he said. In its lofty plans for high-speed rail travel, India also has bullet trains on the board, running at targeted speeds of 250 km/hr. The Mumbai - Ahmedabad is the first route on the map and some progress has also been made. However, there have been delays and the train is expected to be operational only by 2029 with an estimated travel time of two hours 45 minutes. Setting up bullet trains would require building more dedicated tracks. When you build a dedicated track, then you cannot have too many curvatures. There are too many gradients because these are the impediments to speedy track,  Mani said. According to Mani, in the next five years, only the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train plan is expected to materialise, and even the existing tracks wouldnt be able to reach the capacity to run 200 km/hr trains.   India has semi-high-speed trains that can potentially cut travel times substantially, but the lack of necessary allied infrastructure is holding them back.",

In a press release, the legal firm Cranfill Sumner stated that it had filed a claim on plaintiff Alejandro Otero's and his family's behalf. On March 8, 2024, while their son Daniel was at home, a metallic cylinder slab from a cargo pallet that had been released by the International Space Station in 2021 struck the Otero family's house. It left a hole in the floor and roof, but no one was hurt. Debri left a mark on the roof | Instagram A Shocking Discovery Alejandro Otero was on vacation when his son called him with the unbelievable news. A cylindrical object had ripped through their roof and floor, causing significant damage. Thankfully, no one was hurt in the incident. The object was retrieved and sent to the Kennedy Space Center for analysis. NASA confirmed in April that it was a metal component used to hold old batteries on a disposal pallet.  Debri left a mark on the ceiling | Instagram This pallet was jettisoned from the International Space Station in 2021. While most of the pallet was expected to burn up during re-entry, this particular piece remained intact. Seeking Compensation The Otero family, through their law firm, Cranfill Sumner, filed a claim against NASA to recover damages. These damages include repairs to their home, any business interruptions caused by the incident, emotional distress, and the cost of hiring outside help to deal with the situation. In their lawsuit against NASA, the Oteros seek damages for non-insured property, business interruption, mental and emotional distress, and the price of outside agencies' assistance. My clients are seeking adequate compensation to account for the stress and impact that this event had on their lives, the Otero familys attorney, Mica Nguyen Worthy, said in a statement. They are grateful that no one sustained physical injuries from this incident, but a near miss situation such as this could have been catastrophic. If the debris had hit a few feet in another direction, there could have been serious injury or a fatality. according to a report by The Guardian Debri left a mark on the floor | Instagram Attorney Mica Nguyen Worthy, representing the Otero family, highlighted the growing problem of space debris due to increased space activity.

This mission, named RLV-LEX-03 or ""Pushpak,"" successfully landed under more challenging wind conditions, signifying a significant step towards a fully operational RLV. Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs) are the game-changers in space travel. Unlike traditional rockets that are discarded after a single use, RLVs are designed to be recovered and launched again. This significantly reduces the cost of space access, paving the way for more frequent missions and a more sustainable space industry. Let's delve into the efforts of two leading space agenciesISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) and SpaceXin developing RLV technology. The Indian Space Research Organisation (#ISRO) accomplished the third landing experiment of the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV LEX-03) named #Pushpak on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/2PWLgOB70C ISRO's RLV Program Taking Flight with ""Pushpak"" ISRO's Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) program focuses on building a winged, reusable spaceplane. Named ""Pushpak"" after the mythical flying chariot, the RLV-TD is a test bed for crucial technologies needed for a fully reusable launch system. Here's a breakdown of ISRO's RLV journey:  Testing the Waters: The program began with the RLV-LEX (Landing Experiment) series in 2023. These suborbital flights involved dropping the RLV from a helicopter at high altitude and then guiding it to a horizontal landing on a runway. This series successfully demonstrated the vehicle's autonomous navigation and landing capabilities under simulated re-entry conditions. Static fire of Flight 5 Starships six Raptor engines pic.twitter.com/UiF5UG432F SpaceX's Starship SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has taken a more ambitious approach with its Starship program. Starship is a fully reusable launch system consisting of a Super Heavy booster and a Starship spacecraft. Unlike ISRO's winged design, Starship is a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle, similar to a giant rocket. Here's a glimpse into SpaceX's Starship development: Rapid Prototyping: SpaceX has adopted a rapid prototyping approach, building and testing multiple Starship prototypes iteratively. This allows them to quickly learn from failures and incorporate improvements in subsequent versions. Early Milestones: SpaceX has conducted numerous high-altitude test flights of the Starship prototypes, with some achieving successful landings. Notably, on June 6th, 2024, Starship achieved a first: both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft successfully completed a suborbital flight and landed, marking a significant milestone towards full reusability. Comparing ISRO's RLV and SpaceX's Starship ISRO and SpaceX are leading the way in developing reusable launch vehicles. While their approaches differ, both programs aim for reusability and showcase distinct approaches: Design Philosophy: ISRO's RLV-TD is a winged spaceplane designed for horizontal landings. This design offers advantages in terms of maneuverability and potentially lower fuel consumption during re-entry. SpaceX's Starship, on the other hand, utilizes a VTOL design with a simpler, more rocket-like structure.Development Strategy: ISRO has adopted a more cautious and methodical approach, conducting extensive ground testing and suborbital flights before venturing into orbital missions. SpaceX, in contrast, has been more aggressive, rapidly iterating through prototypes and conducting high-altitude test flights. Current Stage: ISRO has successfully demonstrated the core technologies needed for a reusable launch vehicle with the RLV-LEX series.  SpaceX, on the other hand, has achieved the first full launch and landing of both stages of their Starship system, marking a significant advancement.  ELON: SPACEX WILL START BY COLONIZING THE MOONElon spoke on the prospects of living on Mars ahead of the 4th test of SpaceX's starship in June:""It is the first rocket that will make multi-planetary life one of the possible outcomes. I think (that we'll be on the moon) pic.twitter.com/6CFWeSPE5b Challenges and Opportunities Developing RLVs is a complex endeavor. Both ISRO and SpaceX face challenges:  Technical Hurdles: Reusable launch vehicles require advanced heat shielding to withstand the intense temperatures encountered during re-entry. Additionally, perfecting the complex landing maneuvers for both winged and VTOL designs is crucial. Economic Viability: While reusability promises significant cost savings in the long run, the initial development costs for RLVs are high.Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of RLVs are immense.  Reduce Launch Costs:Reusability can drastically lower the cost of space access, enabling more frequent missions and opening up space for new ventures.Enable Sustainable Space Exploration: By reducing the amount of debris left in orbit after each launch, RLVs contribute to a more sustainable space environment.Revolutionize Space Travel: Reusable launch vehicles hold the key to making space travel more accessible and affordable, paving the way for a future with regular space missions and potentially even space tourism.",

Some say they'll buy Ferrari only if it's electric: CEO Vigna,"As Ferrari aims to unveil its first fully electric model next year, CEO Benedetto Vigna said it's trying to balance the needs of younger buyers as well as old established clients. ""Some would-be customers tell me that they would only join the Ferrari community if they could buy an electric...Others say they would never purchase an electric Ferrari,"" he said.",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/ferrari-ceo-vigna-committed-to-engine-battery-options-with-ev-launch-looming?src=tl_story&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Ferrari NV wont be giving up on internal combustion anytime in the coming years, the supercar makers chief executive officer said, as the company remains committed to a full range of powertrains for a wide range of buyers. Even as Ferrari races to unveil its first fully electric model late next year, CEO Benedetto Vigna will push ahead with his strategy to innovate with new technologies while remaining open to an array of solutions, he said in an interview for Bloombergs Italian-language podcast,  Its a delicate balance for the carmaker, as younger buyers skew electric but many established clients are loath to give up Ferraris trademark roar. Some would-be customers tell me that theyd only join the Ferrari community if they could buy an electric, the CEO said. Others say they would never purchase an electric Ferrari. Vignas comments come during a challenging moment for the high-end automotive sector, as manufacturers wrestle to lower emissions at a time when demand for electric vehicles is slowing and governments are scaling back subsidies. Mercedes-Benz Group AG has stopped development of separate underpinnings for electric sedans to save money and plans to sell gasoline-powered cars well into the 2030s. Lamborghinis CEO has said he believes its still too early for the firm to make its signature high-performance sports cars fully electric. But elsewhere, competition in electric vehicles is intensifying. Chinas BYD Co. in February unveiled a 1.68 million-yuan ($232,000) high-performance EV that at least in theory would challenge Ferrari and Lamborghini. Vigna said he prefers to listen to customers rather than fixate on any single technology, which meshes well with the fact that hybrid models  something of a compromise option  accounted for about half of the companys new-car shipments last quarter. Ferrari needs to be able to give customers a unique driving experience regardless of engine propulsion type, Vigna said. That means traditional, hybrid and fully electric options, he said. Still, the CEO has been the driving force behind the gradual shift toward battery power, and a plant dedicated to building hybrid and electric cars will be ready later this week. Its just a matter of listening to different voices to get a full vision, Vigna said. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com 2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Which were India's 10 best-selling cars in May?,"Maruti Swift became India's top-selling car after 19,393 units were sold in May 2024. It was followed by Tata Punch whose 18,949 units were sold in May. It was followed by Maruti Dzire (16,601), Hyundai Creta (14,662), Maruti WagonR (14,492), Maruti Brezza (14,186), Maruti Ertiga (13,893), Mahindra Scorpio (13,717), Maruti Baleno (12,842) and Maruti Fronx (12,681).",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/a-swift-punch-indias-best-selling-car-is-a-maruti-again?src=p1&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"A hatchback is once again Indias best-selling car, amid an outsized demand for oversized cars. The Maruti Suzuki Swift has dethroned the Tata Punch as Indias best-selling car in the same month its latest iteration went on sale, according to data sourced from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.  Sales of the hatchback rose 12% over the year earlier to 19,393 units in May 2024. Though volumes of the compact SUV surged 70% year-on-year, they still were the second highest. That the Swift has reclaimed the top spot is noteworthy, for it shows that hatchbacks cant be written off amid burgeoning sales of SUVs in India. Maruti Suzuki believes hatchbacks are the way to go in a country that has among the lowest car penetration ratios in the world. With only 32 vehicles per 1,000 people, India presents a vast opportunity for automakers, Hisashi Takeuchi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., said at the launch of the fourth-generation Swift on May 9. As car ownership rises, hatchbacks will serve as the entry point for many customers, and thus expand. Hatchbacks make up nearly a third of Indias passenger vehicle market. Maruti Suzuki enjoys more than 60% market share in the segment. But in May 2024, SUV sales surged 26.9% year-on-year to 2,13,462 units, even as those of compact cars fell 13% from the year-ago period, according to SIAM data. In May 2023, their volumes were nearly equal at 1,68,178 and 1,63,619 units, respectively. That gap has now widened, so much so that SUVs now command nearly 60% of incremental sales. Maruti Suzuki is thus sitting on a pile of small cars, as there are few takers. As on May 31, Indias largest carmaker had an unsold inventory of 1.68 lakh carsor 35-36 days of buffer stock. It manufactured 1.93 lakh units last month. Those figures far exceeded the 1.57 lakh units sold. And while its SUVsBrezza, Grand Vitara, Fronx and Ertigaenjoy waiting periods, its breadwinner carsthe Alto K10, S-Presso, Celerio, etc.are finding few takers. That prompted the company to launch a special editiona first in nearly four decades of operationsto clear stock. The all-new Swift, Maruti Suzuki believes, is the catalyst for a turnaround. In less than a month since launch, the fourth-generation of the hatchback has received over 40,000 bookings for just the petrol variant on sale. While the CNG powertrain is some time away, Maruti Suzuki believes that will only add to incremental sales. The new Swift is already our best-selling model, Partho Banerjee, the head of sales and marketing at Maruti Suzuki, said during a sales call on May 1. The CNG variant will be out in a few months. That should shore up our volumes further. Developed at an investment of Rs 1,450 crore, the fourth-generation Swift is powered by an all-new 1,200-cc three-cylinder engine that makes 82 BHP of power. The car, which returns about 25 km/litre, gets six airbags as standard. Its being produced at the companys Gujarat facility. Prices start at Rs 6.49 lakh, ex-showroom India.",

I'm truly sorry: Toyota Chairman Toyoda on cheating on safety test of some cars,"Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda apologised after an investigation found the company cheated on safety test of some car models. ""As the person responsible for the Toyota Group...I am truly sorry,"" he said, bowing at a news conference. The Japanese automaker used inadequate or outdated data in collision tests, conducted incorrect testing of airbag inflation and falsified engine power tests.",https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/40932340.html,"Jun. 03, 2024 Toyota Motor Corporation held a press conference in Tokyo on June 3, 2024 from 5:00 p.m. JST. The video of the press briefing is available below. Monday, June 3, 5:00 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. JST The ending time is subject to change depending on the circumstances. Japanese (English interpretation provided) Explanation, Q&A I am Akio Toyoda. Thank you for attending this press conference today despite the sudden notice. On January 26 this year, we received instructions from Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to conduct an investigation on type designation applications, which we followed. The investigation is still ongoing, but it identified that seven models, including those that have already ended production since 2014, were tested using methods that differ from the standards defined by the national authorities, and we reported this to the Ministry on May 31. This matter involves two companies, Toyota Motor Corporation and Toyota Motor East Japan. As the person responsible for the Toyota Group, I would like to extend my sincere apologies to our customers, car enthusiasts, and all stakeholders for this issue, following Hino, Daihatsu, and Toyota Industries Corporation. I am truly sorry. All the cases are related to certification. The certification system in Japan verifies whether a product meets the established standards mainly in the fields of safety and environment using measurement methods in accordance with rules. Vehicles can only be manufactured and sold after meeting certification test standards. The point of this issue is that the vehicles were mass-produced and sold without going through the correct certification processes. Miyamoto from the Customer First Promotion Group will now explain the details. I am Miyamoto. Please allow me to explain the details. First, we believe that certification is the bare minimum and most important process for mass-producing and selling cars to customers and ensuring that they can be used safely and securely. Broadly, there are three ways of conducting certification. The first is to have an examiner from a designated technical service witness the test. The second is for the automaker to carry out the in-house certification test themselves and submit the data. The third is to submit the compatible development test data for certification. This time, cases were found in the second and third ways. Among them, we have found six specific cases. This is the list of six cases. This is the first case. During the partial redesign of the Crown and Isis in 2014 and 2015, airbag timer ignition development test data was used for certification application. When a collision occurs, occupants are protected primarily by seat belts and airbags. In the case of Isis, we were working on seat belt development to improve its performance. In this development test, a timer ignition method was used to create more severe collision conditions than those in the certification test. In addition, additional model development was being done for the Crown. The purpose of this development test was to confirm the occupant protection performance of seat belts and airbags. A timer ignition method was used to ensure the deployment of the airbags in the test prototype. The performance of automatic airbag ignition had already been verified in an existing model. In both cases, a certification test should have been conducted again under conditions as close as possible to what would be delivered to the customer, and such data should have been submitted. However, the development test data was used for certification. Next, the second case. In 2015, during the development of the Corolla, a test was conducted to check the damage to a pedestrian's head in a collision. Development test data under more severe test conditions were used for certification. As shown in the figure, the impact angle of 65 degrees is a more severe test condition. The test should have been conducted again with the 50-degree impact angle stipulated by regulations, and this data should have been submitted for certification. However, the development test data was used for certification. Next, the third case. In 2015, during the development of the Corolla, Sienta, and Crown, a test was conducted to check the damage to a pedestrian's head and legs in a collision. The data of the opposite side of the applied measuring points was used for certification, and unilateral point data was used for both sides in certification. It was confirmed that the test results for the left and right points of the vehicle show no difference. The test should have been conducted again with the selected measuring points, and this data should have been submitted. There is a process for applying for and obtaining an agreement in advance to determine the measuring points. However, we believe that there was insufficient communication with the technical service about the change of measuring points during the structural changes and the technical verification process during development. Next, the fourth case. This is a test to confirm fuel leakage and other issues due to the impact of a rear-end collision during the development of the Crown in 2014 and the Sienta in 2015. The development test data under more severe test conditions with a moving barrier was used for certification. A 1,800 kg moving barrier was used for the development test, which is heavier than the regulation standard of 1,100 kg; therefore, the test had a greater impact. The test should have been done again using the 1,100 kg moving barrier stipulated by regulations, and this data should have been submitted. Next, the fifth case. During the development of the Yaris Cross in 2020, a test was carried out to examine the damage caused to the rear seat when luggage placed in the rear space of the vehicle moves due to the impact of a collision. After regulation changes, there was an additional requirement for luggage blocks. However, the development test data using the old blocks was submitted for certification application. The test should have been done again using the new blocks, and that data should have been submitted. Lastly, the sixth case. During the development of the Lexus RX engine in 2015, a certification test was conducted to check the engine power. In this test, the targeted power could not be achieved. When a problem like this occurs, the test should have been stopped, the cause investigated, and measures taken. However, the engine control system was adjusted to achieve the targeted power, and the re-tested data was used for certification. This case is different in nature from cases (1) to (5) in that the results were changed to meet the standards. A subsequent investigation has determined that the cause is the partial collapse of the test muffler. The six cases explained can be grouped as: Cases (1) to (5) involve development test data applied for certification, and case (6) involves the automaker conducting its own certification test and submitting that data. In terms of the scale involved in the certifications explained today, we certify about 50 models per year and submit about 7,000 reports over 10 years. The content of one report, for example, in the case of pedestrian protection, includes the results of numerous point collision tests and the results of tests on the left and right sides of the bumper. We do not have the total number of test results at this time, but we have reviewed tens of thousands of test results. Although we are still in the process of reviewing them, we have reported on six cases today. This concludes my explanation. Although still ongoing, our investigation involving tens of thousands of items, has revealed six cases. We have conducted internal verifications on all the cases and confirmed that they all meet the legally defined standards and can be used safely by our customers. We conducted internal verifications on all the cases. We confirmed that all cases meet the legally defined standards and can, therefore, be used safely by our customers. We conducted internal verifications on all the categories. We confirmed that all categories meet the legally defined standards and can, therefore, be used safely by our customers. Nevertheless, these acts shake the very foundations of the certification system, and as an automobile manufacturer, we believe they are acts that must never be committed. After the press conference on January 30 of this year, my immediate action was to ensure that everyone involved, including myself, correctly understood the problem. Therefore, in February, I took the lead and called on Toyota, Hino, Daihatsu, and Toyota Industries to hold the TPS Jishuken (Joint Kaizen Activities) for Certification Work. First, we focused on the processes in which certification-related work was most prone to problems and began by visualizing the material and information flow diagram. As a result, work structure issues have now become clear, and we will carry out concrete improvements. The other day, I went to the genba myself and checked on the progress. The presidents of each company, Oyaji genba leaders, veteran engineers, and young employees who have been working at the company for a few years participated beyond the boundaries of titles and individual corporate frameworks to learn from one another while studying the material and information flow diagram. By doing so, we were able to find where the problems were in the work structure. We also discovered that not only Toyota but also Group companies are facing the same issues. That is where we are at now. Since we are all part of the same Group, we should talk to each other and continue to make improvements together, including top management and genba employees. I feel that we have taken the first step in this direction. I intend to extend our efforts throughout the entire Group and restore authority to the genba to create a solid corporate culture that makes ever-better cars. These efforts will need to be done steadily and will take time, but I will go to the genba myself and take responsibility for their progress. We appreciate your kind attention. Toyota Motor Corporation works to develop and manufacture innovative, safe and high-quality products and services that create happiness by providing mobility for all. We believe that true achievement comes from supporting our customers, partners, employees, and the communities in which we operate. Since our founding over 80 years ago in 1937, we have applied our Guiding Principles in pursuit of a safer, greener and more inclusive society. Today, as we transform into a mobility company developing connected, automated, shared and electrified technologies, we also remain true to our Guiding Principles and many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals to help realize an ever-better world, where everyone is free to move.",

Nissan paid ex-COO Gupta ₹31 cr to quit amid harassment allegations: Report,"Japanese automaker Nissan paid former COO Ashwani Gupta $3.7 million (nearly ₹31 crore) to leave the company after a sexual harassment probe was launched against him, Bloomberg reported. Gupta's compensation was made public in a notice of annual shareholders' meeting. His total pay of nearly ₹39 crore in FY24 is more than what Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida made (₹36 crore).",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/nissan-pays-ex-coo-3-7-million-to-leave-after-sexual-harassment-allegations?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. paid former Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta 582 million ($3.7 million) to depart the company last year amid allegations of misconduct, people familiar with the matter said. Gupta left Nissan in June last year, surprising investors who had seen him as a potential future candidate for the top job. He departed after the company investigated misconduct it considered to be sexual harassment and paid for him to leave, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. That compensation figure is now public in a notice of annual shareholders meeting, which showed Gupta will also receive allowances. A spokesperson for Nissan said the company has no comment beyond the public notice. Gupta declined to comment. Read More: Nissan COO Who Led Post-Ghosn Turnaround Leaving Carmaker Gupta played a leading role steering Nissan back to profitability following the 2018 arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. His remuneration for the year through March 2023 of 726 million even saw him out-earn Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida, who took home 673 million. Other amounts recently paid out to retiring executives include 314 million for former President Hiroto Saikawa. Three other executive directors received compensation ranging from 191 million to 373 million in the same period, according to the securities report for the year that ended in March 2020. While that makes Guptas departure payment comparatively high for Japan, the amount pales in comparison to so-called golden parachute agreements in places like the US. Google agreed to pay as much as $135 million to two top executives who left the company after being accused of sexual harassment. Former Fox News host Bill OReilly, who was ousted over allegations of sexual harassment, was reported to have received as much as $25 million for agreeing to leave the company. Gupta joined Honda Motor Co. in 1996, working in both India and Japan. He subsequently moved to Renault SA in 2006 and worked as an executive at Renault-Nissan BV. After a stint as COO at Mitsubishi Motors Corp., he took the job at Nissan in 2019. He is currently chief executive officer at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. --With assistance from Supriya Singh and Reed Stevenson.

June isnt looking bright either. Whats being reported is actually conservative. Dealers are actually sitting on 4.5-5 lakh units, Vinkesh Gulati, chairman (research and academy) at the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, told NDTV Profit in a telephone interview. The market itself has grown to 3.5 lakh units per month, but more than one lakh units lying in a stockyard is unsustainable. If inventory levels were up to 4 lakh, we would have been comfortable. But they are at least one lakh more, Gulati said. Thats not good for buyers and dealers alike, as cost of holding inventory builds up over months. In fact, the inventory is already at levels seen in the months preceding the October-November festive season, when carmakers stock dealerships to cater to the incoming demand. According to Gulati, inventory levels in May are already at more than 40 days, something seen only in the month of September. Gulati called for paring of production by original equipment manufacturers to align the demand-supply dynamics. The monthly output is about 3.85 lakh. Dispatches in May are seen at more than 3.5 lakh. Thatll only clog the pipeline further.",

Today, the core focus of Turno is primarily on the financing and distribution of three-wheeler cargo EVs. ""We not just provide financing but also support them in the resale value of the vehicles,"" Aluru said. The platform claims to have eight retail outlets in the country and sells these vehicles in a multi-brand format through partnerships with leading manufacturers like Bajaj, Mahindra Electric, Greaves, Piaggio, Euler Motors, etc. According to Aluru, the penetration of three-wheeler cargo EVs has gone up from 7 percent to 30 percent in the last two years. Turno has a presence in about six states: Karnataka, Delhi, Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. The plans are to expand to another 810 states in the next 1215 months. Aluru claims that Turno saw a four-fold increase in business in FY24 and anticipates continuing this trend in the current fiscal year. In addition, Turno intends to launch a few experimental projects in the more recent EV categories, which would include huge form factors similar to commercial buses.

Standalone profit rose 19.8% to 9 billion rupees ($108.36 million) for the three months to March 31, surpassing analysts' estimates of 8.69 billion rupees, according to LSEG data. Input costs came off a high base last year as manufacturers globally battled higher transportation and raw material costs amid conflicts and the lingering impact of the pandemic. Ashok Leyland's input and services costs dropped 7.3% and brought down total expenses by 6.5% to 99.14 billion rupees. Meanwhile, commercial vehicle sales floundered on poor agricultural yield and higher discounts and were coming off a high base. Ashok Leyland's total sales volume fell nearly 6% in the January-March period, as per its monthly sales data, driving a 3.1% fall in its revenue to 112.67 billion rupees. Sales volume of commercial vehicles for market leaders Tata Motors and Eicher Motors, which makes trucks and buses under a joint venture with Volvo, had also fallen in the quarter. The segment, however, is a smaller business for both. Tata Motors and Eicher's profit climbs were on the back of their respective premium vehicle sales - Jaguar Land Rover and Royal Enfield. Ashok Leyland's shares rose as much as 3.3% to a record high after the results.

Though this procedure was introduced by the Central government in 2021, the BRS-led government in the state did not adopt it. The Congress government, however, intends to implement it to simplify the registration process for the common man and also to curb extra earnings of corrupt officials. During an interaction, transport minister Ponnam Prabhakar said showroom registrations will commence once the election code of conduct is lifted. The policy of registering new vehicles at showrooms will be implemented soon in Telangana. This move will greatly benefit new vehicle purchasers. As soon as the election code is lifted, the concerned departments will proceed with the necessary actions. He further added, Since this government was formed, we have introduced several people-friendly reforms and will continue to strive for more. On average, around 2,300 new vehicles are registered daily in Telangana. Vehicle owners have expressed frustration over Telangana not adopting it, while the rest of the country has implemented similar policies. M. Purushotham Reddy, RTO Hyderabad, said, This initiative will be welcomed by both the department and vehicle owners. Each day, around 300 vehicles are registered at the RTA Khairatabad alone. Our officers are engaged in inspections throughout the day. According to P. Ramesh, a showroom owner in the city, While other states have already implemented this system, Telangana is still in the process. For instance, our neighboring state Andhra Pradesh has the same policy. This will save consumers time, as everything will be done at the showroom. The required documents, personal details, vehicle body number, chassis number, photographs, etc., can all be handled at the showroom. Nowadays, people are very busy, and taking a day off for registration is difficult, he explained.",

They found that 2-wheeler bike users usually don't visit authorized service centers for servicing and other repair work. Because of two reasons: One is that the cost is relatively high in authorized centers compared to unauthorized service centers. Second is that the authorized centers are mostly not available in their proximity. Both Venkatesh and Lokesh belong to humble families. While Venkatesh's father, who was an auto-rickshaw driver, went on to become a businessman, earning to survive, Lokesh's father was a farmer, earning to get by. Life until 12th grade was stable as they lived in their respective villages, where expenses were relatively low. However, financial struggles began to arise when they moved to Bangalore for further education. ""We struggled a lot when we moved to Bangalore. We had to look for scholarships for further education,"" recollected Venkatesh while speaking to Startup Pedia. The co-founders of VOC Automotive met in Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic College (SJP), Bangalore while pursuing Engineering in Automobile. Since then, being good friends, they have been in touch despite working in different cities but in the same companies. They both worked at India Yamaha Motor Pvt Ltd and then Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt. While working with Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt. as Area Managers they realized their business acumen and understanding of the market, leading them to venture into entrepreneurship together. The Bangalore-based entrepreneurs found a market gap and wanted to bridge it. Hence, in October 2019, they launched their automobile startup called VOC Automotive in Bangalore. Narrating the entrepreneurial journey with Startup Pedia, Venkatesh said, ""We both were doing great in our careers, earning handsome salaries. However, when we found a market gap, we were so passionate that we decided to embark on entrepreneurship.""  VOC Automotive is a one-stop solution for multi-brand 2-wheeler service and repair. They provide multiple services such as general service, major service, paid services, minor service, accidental services, painting & denting, teflon & silencer coating. The startup provides services at 30% lower charges than others without compromising quality. Moreover, it is also solving the problem of proximity by increasing the number of outlets and doorstep services, offering privileged membership so that customers can reduce their costs by more than 30%. In a groundbreaking move in the industry, they offer a warranty: six months if the engine oil is replaced and two years for any off-engine work, full engine work, or major services. This warranty applies to vehicles starting from 2015. This is happening for the first time in the 2-wheeler industry. The startup has an app, VOC Smart Rider for Customer, where people can book any desired service, and it will be done either at the doorstep or at the nearby VOC Automotive center. The startup is also solving the proximity problem by Aggregating hyperlocal authorized and unauthorized 2-wheeler automobile service centers through Smart Dealer App. Since they had a problem-solving startup plan, they managed to raise Rs. 3 crore as pre-revenue funding to start their business. With the business launching in October 2019 with setting up an office. They were working on launching an outlet when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. That was challenging for them. ""We had investors' money that we were burning for about 50 employees' salaries and office space. It was challenging, but we were positive things would fall into place soon,"" said Venkatesh.  In August 2020, they managed to launch the first VOC Automotive outlet in Bangalore. Since then, there has been no looking back. The Bangalore-based automobile startup operated solely through a single outlet during its inaugural year. Subsequently, its expansion was remarkable. By the second year, it had 6 outlets, followed by 10 in the third year, 12 in the fourth year, and a remarkable 71 outlets by the fifth year. ""It was like a sort of Chinese bamboo story. The number of outlets increased 7x in the fifth year of our business. It is because our existing outlets have been showing continuous profitability and hence, franchisees believed in us and came forward to own our franchises. Many of our franchisees have multiple franchises,"" Venkatesh told Startup Pedia. He further added that, currently, there are 107 outlets. Most of the outlets are in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Karnataka , Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and other cities across South India. Except for one, all the other outlets are franchises.  Talking about the success stories of VOC Automotive franchises, Venkatesh narrated that a franchisee in Karnatakas Chikkaballapur district makes Rs. 2.5 lakh in profit monthly. Regarding the franchisee model, the total investment required for a franchise is approximately Rs. 25 lakhs. The return on investment (ROI) is expected within two years, with operational break-even achievable in six months. As the number of outlets increased, the number of customers also grew gradually. In the second year, there were 5000 vehicles served; in the third year, it served 20,000 vehicles; and in the fourth and fifth years, the Bangalore-based automobile startup managed to serve 3 lakh customers across all their outlets. With this, the startup's revenue has also been growing exponentially. While there was no business in the first two financial years of launching the business, in the third year, which is FY-22, it made Rs. 2 lahks in revenue; in the 4th year (FY-23), it did Rs. 2.7 crores, and in the 5th year (FY-24), it clocked Rs. 10 crores in revenue. Until now, they have raised Rs. 9 crore in total funding. Of this, Rs. 3 crore was secured as pre-revenue funding. Following that, they obtained investment from family and friends. Moreover, CWI ( Corporate warranty India Pvt Ltd ) which has been in the industry for 25 years and has presence in 5 countries also backed the startup. Currently, the startup is valued at Rs. 103 crore. During the interview with Startup Pedia, Venkatesh shed light on the financial growth of the startup and said, ""In FY-25, we are targeting to clock Rs. 100 crore in revenue as we have a rigorous plan for expansion across India."" The startup became profitable last year and currently has 20% EBITDA.  While elaborating on the expansion plan, Venkatesh said that there will be 300 outlets across India, venturing into the north and west parts of India soon. The automobile startup aims to serve 1.88 lakh vehicles in the current financial year. The startup is on a spree of collaboration to provide top notch services. Such as Collaboration with Insurance companies for accidental claims , EV companies for Service Partnering , Petrol (fuel) Pumps and OEM companies. VOC Smart Rider App, which was launched just a year ago, aims to onboard 4 lakh customers in the current financial year. VOC Smart Dealer will function as a hyperlocal aggregator for two-wheeler customers, allowing them to select their preferred service centers. The automobile startup also plans to launch a vertical where customers can buy and sell pre-owned 2-wheelers through the app. With the aim of creating employment, the startup will soon launch an academy, VOC Technical Academy - VTA, to train and employ 2500 people who are 10th pass or fail.

Tesla yet to communicate plans under new EV policy: Govt official,"Elon Musk-owned Tesla is yet to communicate its plans to the Indian government under the new EV policy, a government official told PTI. This comes after Musk, who was scheduled to visit India on April 21-22, postponed his trip citing ""very heavy Tesla obligations"". ""They (Tesla) are just silent...The (EV) policy was always meant for everybody,"" the official said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/automobile/tesla-silent-yet-to-communicate-its-india-plans-official-article-12725636.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"US electric carmaker Tesla is 'silent' and yet to communicate its India plans to the government under the new EV policy, an official said on Friday. American tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was scheduled to visit India on April 21-22, had postponed his visit at the last moment citing ""very heavy Tesla obligations"". Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla, was also slated to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the visit. ""They (Tesla) are just silent.. the (EV) policy was always meant for everybody,"" the official said when asked whether the company has communicated its plans to the government. The commercial decisions are announced by the companies, the official added. An e-mail query sent to Tesla remained unanswered. Earlier in April, he confirmed his visit to India in a post on X saying, ""Looking forward to meeting with Prime Minister @NarendraModi in India"". In June last year, Musk met with Modi during the latter's US visit and stated that he planned to visit India in 2024 while expressing confidence that Tesla would enter the Indian market soon. His proposed visit had raised expectations that he would announce plans for Tesla to set up shop in the country, along with his satcom venture Starlink. It was expected that Musk would announce plans for Tesla to set up its manufacturing unit in India and investments for the same that could be billions of dollars and the way forward for selling Tesla electric cars in India at the earliest. Not just electric cars, he is also eyeing the Indian market for his satellite internet business Starlink, for which regulatory approvals are awaited. Musk had in the past called for import duty reduction in India to be able to sell Tesla cars in the country. His planned visit to India came weeks after the government announced a new electric vehicle policy under which import duty concessions will be given to companies setting up manufacturing units in the country with a minimum investment of USD 500 million, a move aimed at attracting major global players like Tesla. Last month, an advisor representing Tesla  The Asia Group (TAG) attended the first stakeholders' meeting on the new EV policy, along with those from Vietnam's EV maker VinFast and all the major manufacturers in India, including Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata, Mahindra, Kia, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, Renault, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi. The stakeholder consultation meeting was aimed at seeking inputs for the guidelines to be framed for the new EV manufacturing policy. As per the policy, the companies that would set up manufacturing facilities for EV passenger cars will be allowed to import a limited number of cars at lower customs/import duty of 15 per cent on vehicles costing USD 35,000 and above for five years from the date of issuance of the approval letter by the government. At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 70 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on the engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value. CBUs whose CIF value is more than USD 40,000 attract a 100 per cent import duty (for petrol engines size more than 3000 cc and diesel engines of size more than 2500 cc). Whereas those with CIF value under USD 40,000 attract 70 per cent duty (for petrol engine sizes under 3000 cc and diesel engine sizes under 2500 cc). CBUs whose CIF value is more than USD 40,000 attract a 100 per cent import duty (for petrol engines size more than 3000 cc and diesel engines of size more than 2500 cc). The new EV policy seeks to promote India as a manufacturing destination for EVs and attract investment from reputed global manufacturers. Last year, Tesla approached the Indian government seeking duty cuts to import its vehicles in India.       Discover the latest business news, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Delhi to Gurugram in 7 minutes via flying taxis,"Flying taxis, developed by InterGlobe Enterprises and Archer with Boeing's support, are set to revolutionize urban travel. Metropolitan areas like Delhi and Gurugram will soon witness the introduction of these e-VTOL aircraft, promising swift journeys above congested streets. Approval from regulatory authorities is awaited, with fares expected to be slightly higher than traditional options.",https://trak.in/stories/reach-delhi-from-gurgaon-in-7-minutes-via-flying-taxis-how-will-it-work/?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Rohit Kulkarni May 16, 2024  Metropolitan cities are notorious for their congested streets, where bumper-to-bumper traffic is an everyday struggle. However, a revolutionary solution is on the horizon for residents of Delhi and Gurugram, promising to elevate them above the gridlocked roads and into the skies.  InterGlobe Enterprises, the parent company of IndiGo, has partnered with American firm Archer, with backing from aerospace titan Boeing, to introduce flying taxis  an innovative mode of urban transportation that combines the convenience of taxis with the freedom of flight. The Promise of Flying Taxis These flying taxis, known as e-VTOL (electrical vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft, are set to transform the way people travel between cities. With a capacity for five passengers, these taxis offer unparalleled comfort and efficiency. The journey between Delhi and Gurugram, which typically takes hours by road, will now be completed in just 7 minutes. But its not just Delhi and Gurugram; flying taxis will also connect key destinations in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Chennai. The launch is anticipated in 2026, heralding a new era of urban mobility in India. Operational Mechanism The centerpiece of this futuristic transportation system is the 12-rotor Midnight model, designed to provide a seamless travel experience. With ample space for luggage and seating for a pilot and four passengers, these taxis prioritize both comfort and efficiency. Drawing inspiration from similar models in the US, American carrier United is already planning routes between major cities. Archer is awaiting approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US, paving the way for Indias own flying taxi network pending clearance from the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Affordability and Accessibility Nikhil Goel, Archers Chief Commercial Officer, envisions these air taxi services to be just a slight premium over traditional ground transportation options. With fares expected to be approximately 1.5 times the cost of an Uber ride, rapid and hassle-free travel will soon become a reality for urban commuters. For example, a trip from Connaught Place to Gurugram, which currently costs Rs 500 via app-based taxis, will be priced between Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 with flying taxis, offering unprecedented convenience and efficiency. Conclusion The advent of flying taxis represents a significant leap forward in urban transportation, promising to alleviate traffic congestion and revolutionize the way people commute between cities. With their imminent arrival, residents of Delhi, Gurugram, and other metropolitan hubs can look forward to a future where travel is not just efficient but also exhilarating.

It noted that two-wheeler sales picked up 33% on-year, while three-wheeler sales increased 9% on-year. Tractors also grew 1% YoY and commercial vehicles experienced a modest growth of 2% on year. The passenger vehicle (PV) segment achieved a 16% on-year growth. According to FADA, the outlook for May 2024 is shaped by several positive indicators. Improved vehicle supply and strategic planning in the 2W segment have led to rising customer bookings and better market sentiment, driven by favourable crop yields. In the PV segment, new model launches and favourable monsoon forecasts are set to stimulate customer interest, while bulk deals in the CV segment should bolster demand in sectors like iron ore, steel, and cement. The appeal of new electric models and sustained demand for conventional vehicles are likely to provide further momentum. It further said despite these positive trends, challenges remain. Election uncertainty continues to affect market sentiment, delaying customer conversions and stalling purchasing decisions. Financial constraints, extreme temperatures, and overcapacity in the CV segment could slow growth, while heavy discounting in the PV segment could impact profitability.

MD Rajiv Bajaj revealed plans for the production and pricing strategy of Bajaj Autos upcoming CNG bikes. As we reported previously, the Pulsar NS400Z, the companys largest ever pulse, was just launched. Bajaj To Launch CNG Powered Bikes In an interview with CNBC TV18, Rajiv Bajaj shared details about Bajajs future plans for CNG motorcycles. Production capacity for CNG motorcycles will initially be somewhat constrained while the business gauges the markets reaction. CNG motorcycles have divided opinions; some are drawn to them because of the cheaper operating expenses, while others are worried about weight and balance. Bajaj intends to raise manufacturing in response to market demand after initially aiming to sell about 20,000 CNG motorcycles per month. Given Maruti Suzukis 27% market share of CNG cars, there is a lot of promise for CNG motorcycles. As per reports, five to six CNG motorcycles are planned by Bajaj, with the first one scheduled to go on sale on June 18, 2024. CNG Motorcycles Sighted There have been recorded sightings of the CNG motorcycles, which are currently undergoing testing. Unlike reasonably priced electric scooters, Bajajs CNG motorbikes are not aimed towards the entry-level market. The CNG motorbike test mules have alloy wheels, extended seats, digital displays, knuckle guards, and disc brakes. The CNG motorcycles will be introduced by Bajaj under a new brand name; Trekker, Glider, and Marathon are among the possibilities under consideration. The company plans to launch one or two CNG motorcycles this year, with more models to come. Bajajs plans for CNG motorcycle manufacturing and expansion would be influenced by input from the market. Bajaj has a huge chance with the debut of CNG motorcycles, which might lead to exponential development. Rajiv Bajaj stated, The opportunity is phenomenal, expressing confidence in the ventures success. The possibilities are endless when done correctly. In order to satisfy customer expectations, Bajaj is dedicated to providing CNG motorcycles with cutting-edge features and specs. There are other possibilities being evaluated for the new brand, so the official name for Bajajs CNG motorcycles is still under wraps.

"On every Fortuner sale, Govt gets Rs 18 lakh, Toyota gets ₹40,000","The distribution of proceeds from each car sale reveals that manufacturers earn a relatively modest amount, with dealerships and government entities emerging as major beneficiaries. Contrary to popular belief, the bulk of the purchase amount doesn't directly contribute to manufacturers' revenues, highlighting the significant earnings potential for dealerships.",https://trak.in/stories/on-every-fortuner-sale-toyota-gets-rs-40000-govt-gets-rs-18-lakh/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh May 06, 2024 As car prices soar globally, particularly in markets like India, understanding the breakdown of costs involved in purchasing a vehicle becomes essential. Contrary to popular belief, the lions share of the price paid by consumers doesnt always go to the manufacturer. Lets delve into the intricate details of how the proceeds from each car sale are distributed among manufacturers, dealerships, and government entities. Manufacturers Share: Despite the hefty price tags attached to vehicles like the Toyota Fortuner, manufacturers earn a relatively modest amount per car sale. In the case of the Fortuner, Toyota earns a mere Rs 35,000-40,000 per unit, highlighting that the bulk of the purchase amount doesnt directly contribute to the manufacturers coffers. Dealership Commissions: Dealerships play a crucial role in the sales process and earn commissions ranging from 2.5-5 percent of the ex-showroom price for each car sold. For instance, a Toyota dealer could pocket around Rs 1 lakh for every Fortuner sold, showcasing the substantial earnings potential for dealerships. Government Taxes and Levies: The government emerges as a major beneficiary of vehicle sales, with significant portions of the purchase amount allocated to various taxes and levies. In the case of the Fortuner, approximately Rs 13 lakh from the ex-showroom price contributes to government coffers through GST components, registration fees, road tax, and other charges. Operating Profits of Manufacturers: Understanding the operating profits of car manufacturers provides insight into their financial viability. While manufacturers struggle to achieve substantial operating profits per car due to hefty government levies, Kia stands out with the highest operating profit per vehicle, followed by Maruti, Tata, and Hyundai. Conclusion: The breakdown of proceeds from each car sale underscores the complex interplay between manufacturers, dealerships, and government entities in the automotive industry. Despite consumers perception that manufacturers earn the lions share, the reality paints a different picture, with dealerships and government entities reaping significant benefits from vehicle sales.

Tesla revokes internship offers weeks before start date: Report,"Tesla is revoking summer internship offers weeks before interns were about to start, Bloomberg reported citing some students.

The company reportedly laid off senior director Rebecca Tinucci and around 500 employees from its Supercharger business earlier this week.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tesla-interns-say-offers-are-getting-revoked-weeks-before-their-start-date-12713298.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Elon Musks latest cost-cutting victims: summer interns. Tesla Inc. is rescinding offers just weeks before internships were set to start, prompting aspiring employees to take to LinkedIn to appeal to other employers to take them in. At 8:46am, I opened a Tesla email for flight info. By 11:25am, my internship offer was gone, wrote Miami University student Joshua Schreiber, who said his start date was three weeks away and that he had already spent thousands on housing. Schreiber, like many other would-be Tesla interns, are getting uncomfortably close to the end of the school year. They say the surprise calls from Tesla informing students that their offers no longer stand have left them without a lot of time to find replacement gigs for the summer. In one instance, a current Tesla employee posted on LinkedIn, asking her own virtual network to step up and nab one of the interns who was meant to start soon at the carmaker. Please make our loss your gain! wrote Diana Rosenberg, who works in battery supply at Tesla, according to her profile. Rosenberg blamed the decision to rescind the intern offer on the massive layoffs unfolding at the carmaker. Last month, Musk announced that Tesla had made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally. Since then, several executives have left the company as Musk has pushed for further cuts. Most of the companys 500-person Supercharger division and its newly formed marketing team have been axed, Bloomberg News has reported. People familiar with Musks thinking have said the billionaire is determined to cut headcount amid sagging electric vehicle sales and big expenditures for his robotaxi dreams. They say Musk is targeting a 20% reduction, Bloomberg has reported. Revoking intern offers is unlikely to save Tesla much money. At least one of the posts was for an unpaid position, while paid internships at the company typically offer $18 to $28 an hour, according to data from Glassdoor. But the decisions will affect the companys hiring pipeline: More than 3,000 university and community college students from around the world are hired for Tesla internships each year, according to the companys last Impact Report. Perform meaningful work from day one, reads the companys intern website. The move has also delivered a stark life lesson to the students. Rejection is redirection, wrote Brook Gura, a communications student at the University of Texas at Austin, who said that she got a call that her offer was yanked three weeks before her start date as part of the companys mass layoffs. While I am incredibly disappointed that I will not have the summer I intended to have, I know that this moment will only help me grow stronger as a professional. Gura, Schreiber and Rosenberg declined to comment beyond their posts. Musk didnt respond to a request for comment.",

Arebalo is no longer with the company as of this week, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private personnel information. Its not clear whether the HR executive, who reported directly to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, was let go as part of broader job cuts across Tesla or if she stepped down. Musk and Arebalo didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. The electric-vehicle maker has been slashing jobs across the organization, targeting a staff reduction of about 20%, Bloomberg reported last month. Some of Musks top lieutenants have also resigned in the past few weeks, including Senior Vice President Drew Baglino, one of only four named Tesla officers. Musk has been fixated on cutting costs and staff since vehicle sales started to decline in recent months. He also eliminated most of the companys Supercharger team, which oversees partnerships with other automakers in the process of adopting Teslas charging connectors. Arebalo was one of the most senior women at the company. She had been in her role since February 2023 and worked for Tesla for about six years, according to her LinkedIn profile.",

According to an official, getting brownfields included in the policy will be discussed further while making the guidelines. However, the official also mentioned that theoretically it would not be possible to give benefits on the basis of brownfields and OEMs need to set up a separate factory to get the domestic valuation addition (DVA) of 25 per cent in the first three years. Aditya Singh Ratnu, Chief Executive Officer, Zevo India said that our expectations extend beyond mere regulation; we seek a roadmap that incentivizes research and development, infrastructure investment, and market expansion. ""We envision a policy framework that addresses the diverse needs of stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, consumers, and policymakers, fostering collaboration and partnership towards a common goal of sustainability and progress,"" Aditya added. Since the policy has been approved, there have been questions for OEMs if the policy and benefits will allow them to tap into brownfields and not just greenfields to draw benefits under the scheme. Advocating the inclusion of brownfields in the scheme, Kunal Gupta, Founder and CEO, EMotorad said that brownfields offer opportunities to revitalise existing resources, redevelop and create new jobs, address environmental challenges, and reinstate neighbourhoodsall while reducing startup time, costs, and investments and increasing tax revenues."" Raghav Arora, Co-Founder & CTO, Statiq said that the inclusion of brownfields in the policy discussions presents a unique opportunity to repurpose underutilised land for EV infrastructure development. ""Converting brownfields into EV charging stations revitalises urban areas while addressing environmental concerns through sustainable mobility solutions,"" he added. Speaking about the Domestic Value Addition (DVA), Dinesh Arjun, Co-founder & CEO, Raptee said that it is imperative that local manufacturing and a strict control of DVA is ensured. This policy will also help grow and retain the talent pool in India and further our vision to Atmanirbhar Bharat. According to the policy, to achieve the DVA level of 25 per cent by the third year and 50 per cent by the fifth year, the government has sanctioned a customs duty of 15 per cent applicable to completely knocked-down (CKD) units for a duration of five years. Meanwhile, VG Anil, CEO, ARENQ said that EV policy guidelines will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable mobility. He expects that these guidelines should prioritize technological innovation, promote research and development initiatives, and ensure a supportive ecosystem for the growth of the EV batteries industry.

Maruti will launch low-cost hybrid cars for Indians,"Maruti Suzuki, under the umbrella of Suzuki Motor Co., is spearheading efforts to democratize hybrid car technology in India by developing cost-effective solutions. Considering the success of plug-in hybrid vehicles in Europe and the US, Maruti Suzuki eyes their introduction in the Indian market. Anticipating legislative advancements, Maruti Suzuki sees potential growth in the hybrid car segment.",https://trak.in/stories/maruti-will-launch-low-cost-hybrid-cars-for-indians-will-start-with-export-to-europe/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Radhika Kajarekar May 01, 2024 To make hybrid cars more accessible to Indian consumers, Suzuki Motor Co., the parent company of Maruti Suzuki, is working on creating cost-effective technology. Maruti Suzuki is thinking of bringing plug-in hybrid vehicles, which are presently available in Europe and the US, to India. Maruti Suzuki Working On Cost-effective Hybrid Technology The company believes that the market for hybrid technology will develop as a result of improvements in legislation, such as lower taxes on hybrid cars. Hybrid cars combine electric motors and internal combustion engines to provide convenience without the constant need for recharge. Despite being more expensive, hybrid automobiles are becoming more and more preferred than electric ones due to their convenience on a global scale. For the JanuaryMarch quarter, Maruti Suzuki had a 48% increase in net profit, while revenue increased by 20% year over year. On the other hand, its operating performance suffered during the quarter due to a decline in sales of its CNG vehicles. The chairman of Maruti Suzuki claims that high taxes, such the 43% tariff on hybrid vehicles, have an impact on the demand for hybrid cars in India. Sales of hybrid vehicles in the current fiscal year are contingent upon possible tax adjustments made by the GST Council. Maruti To Export Electric Vehicles To Europe Prior to introducing its electric vehicles in India, Maruti Suzuki intends to export them to Europe. The business anticipates that EV production will begin in the current fiscal year, with initial shipments to Europe. According to the chairman of Maruti Suzuki, double-digit growth in the Indian passenger car market is unlikely to occur in FY25. The market for small automobiles, which has been negatively impacted by price increases since the epidemic, is not anticipated to expand considerably over the coming years. Maruti Suzukis deliberate approach to entering the electric vehicle industry is seen in its decision to export EVs to Europe prior to their launch in India. Government regulations and market conditions will have a big impact on how the car industry develops in the near future.

Bajaj Pulsar NS400 Spotted Bolt-shaped LED DRLs and a single LED projector headlamp give the front end a unique appearance. The bike looks aggressive because of the well-designed headlight cowl. The anticipated all-digital instrument cluster, which will be located above the headlight, might have turn-by-turn navigation and Bluetooth connectivity. The bike feels more upscale thanks to the gold-finished USD fork and LED turn indicators.The side profile features an integrated fuel tank extension, a cosmetic improvement over the previous model, based on the Pulsar NS200 design. The bikes appearance is enhanced by a small belly pan and a radiator shroud with a carbon fiber-style sticker.

Single discs in the front and back are used for braking, and dual-channel ABS is standard. There might be ABS modes, like the Pulsar N250. Engine Specs And Features The engine specs are yet unknown, but potential options include the 373cc Bajaj Dominar 400 engine or the 399cc single-cylinder KTM 390 Duke engine.The second engine choice seems more feasible given the desired price point of about Rs 2 lakh. More information will be disclosed on May 3, 2024, the day of the official debut. The performance and features of the Pulsar NS400 are expected to live up to high expectations, making the unveiling a momentous occasion for Bajaj. It is anticipated that Pulsar enthusiasts would be drawn to the bikes muscular and sporting look. The bikes overall appeal is improved by the addition of contemporary technologies like LED lights and Bluetooth connectivity. The anticipated performance metrics, such as the horsepower output, will be critical in figuring out how competitive the bike is in its class. In order to position the Pulsar NS400 against its rivals in the market, pricing will be a key factor.

The pilot test is from May 7 to June 30.",https://thefederal.com/amp/category/states/south/tamil-nadu/madras-hc-orders-e-pass-system-to-enter-nilgiris-kodaikanal-how-will-it-work-120285?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"In a bid to streamline heavy vehicular traffic entering Nilgiris and Kodaikanal during summer, the Madras high court has made e-pass mandatory for non-residents of these two scenic hill stations. Filling up an online form Visitors to these sought after hill stations will probably have to fill up an online form and generate an e-pass. Vehicles with e-pass only will be allowed to enter, said the court, who has asked district collectors of Nilgiris and Dindigul to develop such a system. Kodaikanal is located in Dindigul district. Pilot test from May 7 to June 30 The possession of such e-passes can be properly checked at the entry points without fail. Such a system can be developed and implemented with effect from May 7, 2024 and shall be in vogue on a pilot/test basis up to June 30, 2024, the bench added. New system to be widely advertised There should be adequate publicity about the new system on the website/mobile app which were going to be developed. Advertisements can be issued nation-wide and more specifically in the regional newspapers of the neighbouring states - Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, said the division bench comprising Justices N Sathish Kumar and D Bharatha Chakravarthy. This order was given on Monday (April 29) while passing interim orders in a case relating to fixation of carrying capacity in respect of the Nilgiris and Dindigul districts. Exemption for vehicles of local residents The vehicles of local residents, commercial vehicles regularly carrying agricultural products can be exempted by issuing an appropriate notification, the bench suggested. It has to be worked out if the e-passes either have to be valid for one entry or for multiple entries, there must be a related provision, said the bench. Why court decided to regulate vehicle entry? A ""whopping"" 20,011 vehicles enter the Nilgiris every day, which includes 11,509 cars and 6,524 two-wheelers on an average during the peak season, the court said, adding, ""it can be seen that the situation is alarming.""  ""There can be absolutely no place even for movement of traffic and it is affecting everyone, the residents, the tourists, the visitors etc., without exception. More specifically, the local residents can not move even for their regular livelihood including for medical emergency and their very right to life is affected; the tourists also cannot reach their destinations and it spoils their very experience... the environment is the worst affected,"" the court said. Meddling with elephant corridors The roads were carrying beyond their capacity. It can also be seen that all these routes were ""meddling/interfering with the elephant corridors."" And in view of traffic jams, vehicles are stranded in the roads cutting across forests and the animals are worst affected. It causes irreparable damage to the environment, the bench noted. Traffic management  The court also directed Nilgiris district collector to also ensure the traffic management for the current season, particularly, consider stopping tourists vehicles entering via Kalhatti Ghat Road. This is because it is said to be one of the primary reasons for the traffic congestion as well as detrimental to the environment. The Collector shall, however exempt the vehicles of the local residents, the bench added and posted to July 5, further hearing of the case.

Ather Energy founder and CEO Tarun Mehta has emphasised on the increased spending on research and development (R&D) in the auto industry saying Given the demographic advantage we are sitting on, our policy focus on RnD needs to go up in an immense way. He said that entrepreneurs need to target an R&D of a million engineers in India. ""Given the demographic advantage we are sitting on, our policy focus on R&D needs to go up in an immense way. Remember, suppliers come and setup capacities where OEMs produce. OEMs produce where their new product development (NPD) happens. And NPD happens where there are engineers. That's why China today wins the NPD game so that it can continue to maintain its eventual manufacturing advantage,"" he wrote on X. The post was in context with Chinese carmaker BYD's R&D strategy where is has claimed that the company has been expanding its R&D team for several years with the number of engineers hired by the company growing 31.5 per cent year-on-year to around 40,400 in 2021. That number increased 72.6 per cent year-on-year to nearly 70,000 as of last year. ""Apparently BYD now has more people in R&D than the rest of the auto industry outside of China, COMBINED,"" he added. He said that the most important progress is technological progress and China, for all its faults, is doing good job on this. ""An R&D team size approaching one lakh people with some 20-30K engineers hired last year alone! Almost 10 per cent of their revenue is spent on R&D, even at the scale of USD 40-50 billion in annual revenues,"" he added. He said that Indian companies are often quite happy seeing a 3-4 per cent R&D spend but we need to focus a lot on the numbers otherwise no one can beat a 10-100X numbers advantage. ""If we have a 10-20X growth ahead of us for the next few decades then we need to target big numbers everywhere. 10-15 per cent R&D spend in all critical sectors. A million engineers in all critical sectors,"" he said. Replying to a comment on the micro-blogging platform, he said that key concern is a fear of investing in R&D. Too many promoters, and even professional CEOs weren't engineers in the past. And very few have seen value creation happen by 'building'. Too many CEOs rewarded for successful 'joint ventures' rather than for being kick ass builders. Feature Writer           Is email marketing worth it anymore?

The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Centre of China have published a list of 76 models of intelligent connected vehicles that meet the countrys auto data security requirements, including those from Tesla. The list was released after security tests jointly conducted by the two organisations clearing models of local Chinese electric vehicles, including Li Auto, Lotus, Hozon New Energy Automobile, and NIO, besides BYD and Tesla, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. In tests starting in November 2023, cars were assessed to see if they met four compliance requirements: The tests were carried out according to related laws and standards, and the carmakers submitted their models voluntarily, according to the Association. The Association said that the test aimed to help regulate auto data processing, protect the rights of car users, and build a sound environment for auto data security and the industry. Significantly, Tesla was included in the list, which was released right after Musk flew to Beijing on a surprise visit. This was Musks second visit to China, which is Teslas second-biggest market. Built and put into operation in 2019, the Shanghai factory, Teslas first Gigafactory outside the United States of America, delivered 947,000 vehicles in 2023, which was 33 per cent more than in 2022. Reports had said that Tesla vehicles faced restrictions in China in an increasing number of meeting halls and exhibition centres across the country, besides military bases. Even highway operators, local authority agencies, and cultural centres reportedly began restricting the Tesla EVs, which began impacting its sales in China. Musk arrived in Beijing on Sunday at the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Tesla was already in negotiations with the Chinese authorities about the lifting of all restrictions, the state-run China Daily reported. Elon Musk and Chinese trade promotion council head meet in Beijing pic.twitter.com/MdwguYf5sO Tesla said in a statement that the endorsement of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles assembled at the Shanghai Gigafactory would lead to an easing of restrictions on its cars access to certain state-backed entities, airports and motorways. The result of the review will give Tesla car owners and other fans of its cars a lot of confidence in driving them on the streets of China, said Chen Jinzhu, CEO of the consultancy Shanghai Mingliang Auto Service. Since the CAAM is a government-backed auto industry association, the review certainly will have an influence on relevant authorities policymaking, Chen told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. The endorsement also bodes well for Chinas probable approval of Teslas Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, its autonomous driving software, for which Musk reportedly is lobbying. Premier Li said that Teslas operations in China represented a successful example of an economic tie-up between China and the US, as he encouraged more co-operation between the two countries. Musks visit to Beijing aims to bring the Texas-based carmakers autonomous driving technology to China amid intensified competition with local competitors in an EV market that accounts for about 60 per cent of global sales, the Post reported on Sunday.

Chinas huge market would always remain open to foreign enterprises, he emphasised. Musk said thanks to the hard work and wisdom of the Chinese team. He said that it was good to see electric vehicles making progress in China, and added that all cars will be electric in the future.  According to China Daily, the countrys new energy vehicle sales surged 37.9 per cent year-on-year to about 9.5 million last year, accounting for more than 60 per cent of the global total.

US regulator finds Tesla autopilot had a role in 13 fatal crashes,"American auto-safety regulators have said their probe into Tesla's Autopilot feature found that it was involved in at least 13 fatal crashes. The probe also found the company's claim did not match up to reality. It found evidence that ""Tesla's weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot's permissive operating capabilities"", which resulted in a ""critical safety gap"".",https://www.connectedtoindia.com/us-regulator-finds-tesla-autopilot-was-involved-in-13-fatal-crashes/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"American auto-safety regulators have said their probe into Teslas Autopilot feature found that it was involved in at least 13 fatal crashes. The probe also found the companys claim did not match up to reality. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) disclosed on Friday that during its three-year Autopilot safety investigation, which it launched in August 2021, it identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving one or more death, and many more involving serious injuries, in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role, The Guardian reported. It also found evidence that Teslas weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilots permissive operating capabilities, which resulted in a critical safety gap. The NHTSA also raised concerns that Teslas Autopilot name may lead drivers to believe that the automation has greater capabilities than it does and invite drivers to overly trust the automation, The Guardian reported. The agency also found that the companys autopilot may even discourage drivers from taking manual control of the vehicle compared to other automated driving systems. NHTSAs new investigation focuses on the software update Tesla rolled out to fix these issues in December, which prompts drivers with increased warnings and alerts to pay greater attention when using Autopilot and Autosteer, reported The Verge. Reacting to the development, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement: Within days of Teslas December recall of Autopilot, it became clear the company had not done enough to protect drivers and all road users from the dangers of this unsafe technology. That is why, last week, we sent a letter to NHTSA urging the agency to more urgently steer Tesla towards safety. As part of NHTSAs new query, the agency should require Tesla to restrict its Autopilot feature to the roads it was designed for. We urge the agency to take all necessary actions to prevent these vehicles from endangering lives, they said. In August 2021, Senators Markey and Blumenthal sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), calling for it to launch an investigation into Teslas advertising of driving automation systems. In February 2022, Senators Markey and Blumenthal sent a letter to Tesla Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk following numerous reports of dangerous braking flaws in Teslas Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems and amid several federal safety investigations, voicing serious concerns with the implementation of the companys technology.

Bajaj to launch world's first CNG motorcycle,"Bajaj Auto plans to launch the world's first commercially available CNG-powered bike, a move amidst the rising popularity of EVs. With its history of CNG three-wheelers, Bajaj aims to transfer this technology to motorcycles. Despite the potential for lower running costs and emissions, challenges remain in pricing, infrastructure, and market acceptance compared to electric alternatives.",https://www.thecore.in/top-stories/bajaj-wants-to-introduce-the-worlds-first-cng-bike-but-will-it-work-4506740?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"With CNG bikes, Bajaj Auto is trying to make history. At a time when electric vehicles are gaining popularity, the product isn't as promising as its rickshaws once were. First came the electric vehicles (EVs). And now, another clean energy alternative is offering itself as an option for two-wheeler owners. Compressed natural gas, known as CNG in common parlance, is being used to power a portfolio of bikes that Bajaj Auto is developing. CNG two-wheelers aren?t entirely unheard of, but this will be the first set of bikes that consumers can buy commercially. So far, state government-backed pilot projects that retrofitted CNG kits on scooters encountered several hiccups in performance, infrastructure issues and cost, which hindered wider adoption. Retrofitting typically involves modifying a vehicle to incorporate a new technology or component, such as adding a CNG kit to an internal combustion engine vehicle. A pioneer of CNG technology in India, Bajaj rolled out its first CNG three-wheelers in the early 2000s, soon after the Supreme Court?s 1998 directive for all public transport (buses, taxis, and auto-rickshaws) in Delhi to be made CNG-powered. In 2022, about 95,000 CNG auto rickshaws were running in Delhi. Today, the automaker leads the three-wheeler market, with a 67% market share in FY2024. And nearly three-fourths of its three-wheeler sales First came the electric vehicles (EVs). And now, another clean energy alternative is offering itself as an option for two-wheeler owners.

In 2022, about 95,000 CNG auto rickshaws were running in Delhi. Today, the automaker leads the three-wheeler market, with a 67% market share in FY2024. And nearly three-fourths of its three-wheeler salesare driven by CNG variants. It is just a question of shifting their technology from three-wheelers to two-wheelers and trying to find the best and optimum usage, veteran auto expert and classic car restorer Tutu Dhawan toldThe Core. Not only have previous attempts at CNG two-wheeler prototypes by certain state governments failed, but Bajaj has also said that its CNG motorcycles will be priced higher than their petrol counterparts. With EVs rising in popularity and the wide gaps in CNG infrastructure, one wonders what led Bajaj down this path and whether its project will find success.  CNG is cleaner  emits less carbon dioxide  and cheaper. Currently, in Delhi, CNG costs Rs 76.59 per kg compared to Rs 94.72 for a litre of petrol. This has prompted state governments across India to push for CNG adoption, which has even found some success. The highest rate of adoption still remains limited to commercial vehicles like taxis and rickshaws. CNG vehicles are a small share of the total vehicles sold in India and three-wheelers sales in the category are also slowing down, thanks to electrification. In FY24, about 3,03,817 of the total 9,86,797 three-wheelers sold were CNG (about 31%), while about 54% were EVs. CNG infrastructure is mostly limited to urban centres at the moment, with Gujarat and Maharashtra having the highest number of CNG stations. There are currently alittle over 6,000 CNG stations in the country.  As EVs become more popular, Bajaj too, is investing heavily in its EV business. For FY2025, the company has set a capex of about Rs 800 crore, mostly for its three-wheeler plant, and its electric scooters under the Chetak brand. The companys CFO Dinesh Thapar toldThe Economic Times that investment in the CNG bike was not large and that the bulk of their capex was being spent on the capabilities and capacities of our electric business. But why then is Bajaj investing in CNGs?The Core reached out to the company and will update this story upon receiving a response.  The company is developing a line of motorcycles, which promise good mileage, lower emissions and cost efficiency. According to industry speculation, the first bike, which will likely be launched in June, might be in the110-125 cc segment. Like all CNG vehicles, it is expected to have a bi-fuel option for CNG as well as petrol usage. In aninterview with CNBC-TV18, the companys CEO Rajiv Bajaj said that they observed 50% less CO2 emissions and a reduction of 50-65% in operating costs when comparing their CNG prototype to an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. The lower operating cost also makes the bike a better option for mileage-conscious users, which Bajaj is targeting. As a fuel, CNG is cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient compared to other gasoline options[and] CNG two-wheelers will mean another fuel-variant option available with buyers, Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings toldThe Core.  In 2016, the Delhi government started a pilot project  a CNG prototype of a Honda Activa was given to 30 delivery riders of a pizza chain. The project, however,failed to take off. Similarly, Maharashtra and Chandigarh also introduced CNG kits for two-wheeler scooters, which could be retrofitted, in 2017. For all three states, the kits were manufactured by two players  either ITUK Manufacturing or Eco Fuel Systems Pvt Ltd (the Indian arm of Lovato), which had received approvals from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). The kits for two-wheelers came with two cylinders of about 0.6-1.2 kg each, which could run up to 100km per kg. However, these prototypes didnt have many takers. In 2017, there were about25 CNG-fitted scooters in Mumbai. Theres no available data on how many scooters are present now. A three-wheeler CNG retrofitter in Mumbais Kandivali told The Core that two-wheeler users werent enticed because of the cost of fitment, the bulk of the cylinders, and issues like pickup. The Honda Activa CNG prototypes struggled with power in CNG mode and users were advised to use it in petrol mode for a few kilometres and then switch to CNG. Plus, the CNG cylinder, or tank, is an issue as well. You can't have it too big and you can't have it too small, Dhawan said. If it is small, you won't get the mileage, if it is big, it becomes bulky and expensive. So, you have to find the right balance. Theres also the infrastructure issue. One, CNG refilling centres are limited to certain areas. A user might be forced to shift to petrol mode, if they cant find a refilling centre. Two, these usually have long wait times, taking anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes to fill up a tank. This would be a significant pain point for a private user. EV users face long wait times for charging too, however, they have the option to charge their scooters at home. CNG users would not have this option. Lastly, one must take into account the cost. The cost of fitting a CNG kit for a two-wheeler is approximately Rs 15,000-20,000. The cost of Bajajs bike is also expected to be higher than petrol variants in the same segment. The company is banking on the fact that the lower cost of CNG, and subsequently the lower operating cost of the bike will be promising for the user. But with CNG costs higher, the difference may not be that great as compared to the operating cost of a petrol or diesel bike. Sethi pointed out that the cost of acquisition and cost-effectiveness (in terms of mileage, efficiency and maintenance), Bajajs CNG bikes is yet to be ascertained. [This] will influence the sales and future demand for this fuel-variant, he said.  Theres been a global cooldown when it comes to EV demand, and therefore it may be wise to look at other clean fuel alternatives. But in India, EVs are still having a moment, especially two- and three-wheelers. Electric two-wheelers made up 60% of the overall EV sales in FY2024. This, despite the government slashing the FAME-II subsidy for electric two-wheelers in June 2023. Electric two-wheeler penetration is expected to grow exponentially, making up 60-70% of sales by 2030. This fiscal year, the government has extended incentives for electric two- and three-wheelers under the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024, after the FAME-II scheme ended in March 2024. This, coupled with increasing charging infrastructure, means that EVs not only pose stiff competition but could very well take the pie.

While the private players in electric vehicle sector and government are pushing their limits to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles in India, charging infrastructure in the country has shown an improvement. Earlier the government revealed that there are only 12,146 public charging stations are operating in India, which sparked the concern over the achievement of its 30@30 target. However, the situation has changed and improved for a better. According to a report, the Combined Charging System (CCS2) is witnessing two-fold growth in a year. The CCS2 charging points have risen in states like Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. According to the report by ExperiencesWithEV, a research analysis firm that tracks the EV sector in India, Six months ago, there were 21 charge point operators (CPOs) with at least 15 charging guns in a state/UT. However, now there are 23 CPOs with at least 20 charging guns. Speaking on this, Amit Lakhotia, Founder & CEO, Park+ said that as India's services sector increasingly adopts EVs, it serves as a beacon of inspiration, demonstrating the immense potential for widespread opportunities in the increasingly interconnected EV ecosystem. ""Incorporating electric vehicles (EVs) into India's services sector represents a transformative leap towards a greener and more sustainable future.

Concerns have been raised regarding the sedan's ability to ensure the safety of child occupants, highlighting the need for enhanced safety features and standards in the automotive industry.",https://trak.in/stories/shocking-honda-amaze-gets-2-star-safety-rating-this-is-how-honda-has-responded/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh Apr 24, 2024 The Honda Amaze sub-compact sedan has recently undergone crash tests by the Global NCAP, resulting in a downgrade from its previous four-star safety rating to just two stars. This significant drop in safety rating has raised concerns about the sedans overall safety standards, particularly in terms of child occupant protection. Recent Test Results In the latest Global NCAP crash tests, the Honda Amaze scored poorly in the child occupant protection category, leading to its diminished safety rating. This marks a stark contrast from five years ago when the model received a commendable four-star rating. The tests were conducted under the new protocols introduced by Global NCAP in the previous year. Safety Concerns The Honda Amaze displayed inadequacies in ensuring the safety of child occupants during frontal impact tests. Issues such as poor protection of the childs head, chest, and neck were observed, particularly for children aged 1.5 years. The absence of essential safety features like three-point seat belts in all seats contributed to the sedans subpar performance in child occupant protection tests. Manufacturer Response Honda Cars responded to the latest safety rating of the Amaze sedan, citing the South Africa spec second-generation models previous four-star rating by GNCAP in 2019. The company highlighted that while the overall score remains at a five-star level, the absence of certain equipment such as Electronic Stability Control and Side Curtain Airbags resulted in the lower rating in the recent test. Safety Features and Specifications Despite the downgrade in safety rating, the Honda Amaze offers a range of standard safety features, including ABS with EBD, rear-view camera, child lock, anchor points for child seats, overspeed warning, and anti-theft engine immobilizer. However, the absence of additional safety features like ESC and side curtain airbags has impacted its overall safety assessment. Future Outlook The Honda Amaze remains a prominent offering in the Indian sedan market, alongside models like the City and City Hybrid. With the launch of the facelift version in 2021 and expectations of an updated version soon, Honda aims to address safety concerns and enhance the sedans overall appeal. The Amaze is available with two engine options  a 1.2-liter petrol and a 1.5-liter diesel  coupled with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT gearbox. Conclusion While the Honda Amaze continues to be a popular choice among sedan enthusiasts in India, its recent safety rating downgrade underscores the importance of prioritizing safety features and standards in automotive design and manufacturing. As consumers increasingly prioritize safety in their purchasing decisions, manufacturers must strive to address safety concerns and deliver vehicles that meet the highest safety standards set by organizations like Global NCAP.

Join our Telegram Channel                                 https://t.me/InvestmentGuruIndiacom Download Telegram App before Joining the Channel More than one in five cars sold worldwide this year is expected to be electric, with surging demand projected over the next decade set to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport, the new edition of the IEAs (International Energy Agency) annual Global Electric Vehicle Outlook said on Tuesday. The Outlook finds global electric car sales are set to remain robust in 2024, reaching around 17 million by the end of the year. In the first quarter, sales grew by about 25 per cent compared with the same period in 2023 -- similar to the growth rate seen in the same period a year earlier, but from a larger base. The number of electric cars sold globally in the first three months of this year is roughly equivalent to the number sold in all of 2020. In 2024, electric car sales in China are projected to leap to about 10 million, accounting for about 45 per cent of all car sales in the country. In the US, roughly one in nine cars sold are projected to be electric -- while in Europe, despite a generally weak outlook for passenger car sales and the phase-out of subsidies in some countries, electric cars are still set to represent about one in four cars sold. This growth builds on a record-breaking 2023. Last year, global electric car sales soared by 35 per cent to almost 14 million. While demand remained largely concentrated in China, Europe and the US, growth also picked up in some emerging markets such as Vietnam and Thailand, where electric cars accounted for 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, of all cars sold. Substantial investment in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain, ongoing policy support, and declines in the price of EVs and their batteries are expected to produce even more significant changes in the years to come. The Outlook finds that under the policy settings, every other car sold globally is set to be electric by 2035. Meanwhile, if countries announced energy and climate pledges are met in full and on time, two in three cars sold would be electric by 2035. In this scenario, the rapid uptake of electric vehicles -- from cars to vans, trucks, buses, and two- and three-wheelers -- avoids the need for around 12 million barrels of oil per day, on a par with current demand from road transport in China and Europe combined. The continued momentum behind electric cars is clear in our data, although it is stronger in some markets than others, said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth. The wave of investment in battery manufacturing suggests the EV supply chain is advancing to meet automakers ambitious plans for expansion. As a result, the share of EVs on the roads is expected to continue to climb rapidly. Based on todays policy settings alone, almost one in three cars on the roads in China by 2030 is set to be electric, and almost one in five in both the US and European Union. This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector. The report finds that manufacturers have taken major steps to deliver on the strengthening EV ambitions of governments, including by making significant financial commitments. Thanks to high levels of investment over the past five years, the worlds capacity to produce batteries for EVs is well positioned to keep up with demand, even as it rises sharply over the next decade. The pace of the transition to EVs may not be consistent and will hinge on affordability, the report emphasises. In China, more than 60 per cent of electric cars sold in 2023 were already less expensive to buy than their conventional equivalents. However, in Europe and the US, the purchase prices for cars with internal combustion engines remained cheaper on average, though intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce prices in the coming years. Even where upfront prices are high, the lower operating costs of EVs mean the initial investment pays back over time.

The 15-year PPA with the Matrix Renewables-led Stillhouse Solar Project from 2025 to 2040 will be used to operate Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, the South Korean auto giant's first dedicated EV mass production plant in the North American country, currently under construction in the state of Georgia. The energy will also be used in the electrification-related operations of Hyundai Mobis' North American business and Hyundai Steel's production plant in Georgia, reports Yonhap news agency. According to Hyundai, the deal marks the biggest PPA signed by a South Korean company for the use of renewable energy at its US facilities. Financial terms weren't disclosed. Hyundai said the expected carbon reduction effect through the deal amounts to approximately 140,000 tonnes annually, which roughly amounts to the carbon emissions from around 84,000 midsize sedans over the course of one year.

EVs unlikely to make profits at unit level despite PLI: Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto CFO Dinesh Thapar said electric vehicles (EVs) are still a long way from being profitable at unit level, even with the Centre's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.

The price reduction to make the EV more affordable is outrunning cost reduction, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/evs-unlikely-to-be-profitable-at-unit-level-even-after-pli-bajaj-auto-12671531.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The EV two-wheeler is still long away from being profitable at unit level even with the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI), said Dinesh Thapar, Chief Financial Officer of Bajaj Auto. Will PLI, in the case of electric two-wheeler, lead to unit level profitability? The answer is no. We are still some distance away, Thapar said in the conference call after the company posted its Q4 results. Thapar said with cost rationalization and alternate sourcing, the company is bridging the gap. But added that they havent completely filled the gap, even for EV three wheeler. There will be leverage benefits that will help the unit economics as volumes grow up. But the most fundamental piece is the price said Thapar. The company explains that pricing has played a role in the unit economics not being profitable. The price reduction to make the EV more affordable is outrunning the cost reduction. Thapar pointed out that pricing has come off over last four quarters and it is essentially front running the cost reduction, which will play out over a period of time. He said the unit profitability will get better assuming the price point stays where it is and when cost reduction benefits play over time. In its Q4 results, Bajaj Auto reported an 18 percent jump in its net profit to Rs 2,011.43 crore. The pune based auto makers revenue went up to Rs 11,249.8 crore for the January-March quarter this year, up by 30 percent from Rs 8,660 crore during the same period last year. The company also announced a dividend of Rs 80 per share (800 percent) of face value of Rs 10 each on equity share.",

Tesla is also expected to start importing its cars to India and make an investment in the country, Reuters has reported, but Tata's plan if realised would make it the first local carmaker to opt for the policy designed to increase use of electric vehicles (EVs). A Tata spokesperson declined to comment on what it said was speculation. The policy announced in March cuts import taxes to 15% from as high as 100% on some EV models if a carmaker invests at least $500 million and sets up a domestic factory within three years. Tata had originally pressed the Indian government not to lower duties to protect the domestic industry. Now, Tata and JLR are discussing the possibility of applying for incentives under the EV policy, said a third source aware of the company's plans, adding that deliberations are at an early stage. ""Tata wants to import JLR (EVs) under this new policy,"" said one of the two government sources, who declined to be named as the company plans are confidential. While Tata is firming up plans to import JLR EVs from the United Kingdom, it is also planning to manufacture JLR cars at a planned $1 billion plant in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. It remains unclear which JLR cars Tata will make there. The Indian government met with car industry representatives on Thursday to begin finalising a framework for the policy, the official said. The meeting was attended by Hyundai Motor Co, Vinfast, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra and Mahindra, Toyota Motor Co and others. A Tesla representative was also present. The official said at least another couple of meetings would follow. Tata dominates India's small but growing EV market. Electric models made up about 2% of total car sales in 2023, with the government targeting 30% by 2030, even as demand in key markets such as the United States and China is slowing.

Tesla asks shareholders to reapprove Musk's $56 bn pay package,"Tesla has asked shareholders to vote again in favour of CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package after a Delaware court voided it in January. The package, approved by shareholders in 2018, wasn't ""entirely fair"" to the shareholders, the court ruled. ""Elon hasn't been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years,"" the company said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tesla-asks-shareholders-to-re-ratify-elon-musks-56-billion-payout-12659921.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Tesla Inc. will have shareholders vote again on its compensation package for Elon Musk after a Delaware court voided the $56 billion award arranged for the chief executive officer in 2018. In its proxy filing issued Wednesday, Tesla also said it will call a vote on moving the companys state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware. The electric-car maker will convene its annual meeting on June 13. Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm criticized the Delaware Chancery Courts January decision, writing in the proxy that it amounted to second-guessing shareholders who had approved Musks compensation. Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick described the companys directors as supine servants of an overweening master and said they hadnt looked out for the best interests of investors. Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value, Denholm wrote. The shareholder who sued Tesla over the CEOs compensation criticized it as excessive and opaque. Musk, who runs six companies, said early this year he preferred to work on artificial intelligence and robotics products elsewhere unless he owns a 25% stake in Tesla. He now owns about 13% of the company. Tesla shares rose 1.1% as of 7 a.m. New York time, before the start of regular trading. The stock tumbled 37% this year through Tuesdays close.",
Cybertruck deliveries halted over faulty accelerator pedal: Report,"Tesla has halted deliveries of Cybertrucks over an issue with the accelerator pedal, Engadget reported citing complaints posted on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum. As per a user, Tesla issued a recall over the problem.

This information was discovered through discussions on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum, where users reported receiving notifications about their deliveries being rescheduled.  One user revealed that their dealer informed them about a recall of the truck due to issues with its accelerator pedal.  Another user received a text from Tesla, stating that deliveries are currently on hold for the same reason. Several other users received texts regarding issues related to ""the preparation of your vehicle.""  A fan account of Elon Musk, @WholeMarsBlog, tweeted that deliveries have been paused for seven days. However, this information is confirmed and the carmaker did not respond to inquiries from The Verge.  It's worth noting that the EV manufacturer disbanded its PR department years ago, and typically does not respond to reporter questions. The main concern appears to be related to the accelerator pedal getting stuck.  A video posted by a Cybertruck owner, depicted how their accelerator pedal cover got stuck and ""held the accelerator down 100%, full throttle.""  The owner noted that pressing brake stopped the truck from accelerating further, but if they released it, the truck would start accelerating again.  This is a significant safety concern for a vehicle that weighs 3,175kg, and can reach 0-97km/h in less than three seconds. In another incident reported on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum, a user claimed their vehicle accelerated into a signal pole on its own, and neither brake pedal nor airbags functioned properly.  However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration blamed user error in its 2021 review of complaints about Tesla cars accelerating on their own.  Prior to this review, the Musk-owned firm settled a class action lawsuit in 2018 related to similar claims, thereby avoiding a trial. Live",

This was revealed by a US news portal, Electrek, dedicated to electric transportation and sustainable energy. Duplication of roles The layoffs had become crucial after ""rapid growth"" led to duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas"", the Tesla CEO said in the internal email to staff, reported Electrek. ""As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is  extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions  and increasing productivity,"" Musk wrote, adding that as part of this effort, they have made the ""difficult decision"" to reduce their headcount by more than 10 per cent globally.  ""There is nothing I hate more, but it must  be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle,"" he wrote, said the report. According to Tesla's latest annual reports, the leading EV manufacturer had 140,473 employees globally. If the job cuts apply company-wide, the layoff could affect at least 14,047 employees. This announcement comes days after Tesla reported a drop in first quarter auto  deliveries even though it implemented a series of price cuts on its EVs to  boost demand. Shares of Tesla fell 0.4 per cent in pre-market trading. Meeting with PM Modi This news also comes ahead of a much hyped-up meeting Musk has scheduled with Prime Minister Narendra  Modi in India some time this month. Musk comes to India even as the country gets into its seven-phased national election from April 19. The maverick billionaire is expected to make an announcement about his  plans to open a new Tesla factory in India.

This move comes as the company's global vehicle deliveries experienced a dip for the first time in almost four years. The company is reportedly considering Mumbai and New Delhi as potential showroom locations. The initial plan is to establish a service hub and a showroom in each location, ranging between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet. Tesla has also started manufacturing right-hand-drive vehicles at its German facility. These vehicles are intended for export to India. This development follows India's recent decision to reduce import duties on electric vehicles from 100% to 15%. This reduction applies to manufacturers who establish a factory and invest at least INR 41732.88 million. Reports suggest that Tesla officials began scouting for locations last month. They have been in discussion with many real estate developers about potential locations for malls and high streets. The company aims to start construction as soon as possible and open the showrooms in 2024. In an earlier development, it was reported that Tata Electronics had signed an agreement with Tesla for semiconductor chips. Tesla's expansion into India comes at a time when the company is grappling with the slower growth of electric vehicles in China and the United States, its two primary markets. Earlier this month, it was reported that Tesla had shelved a low-cost vehicle that was expected to drive the expansion of the mainstream market. India is the world's third-largest auto market. It is expected to see a surge in demand for electric vehicles. In 2023, only 2% of all cars sold in India were electric vehicles. However, the government has projected that by 2030, 30% of all new cars sold in India will be electric. This makes India a promising market for Tesla's expansion plans.",
"Maruti, Tata Motors venture into car subscriptions","OEMs like Maruti and Tata Motors are venturing into car subscription services in India, aiming to offer flexible ownership options. However, the market response has been tepid with the concept capturing barely 1% market share. The challenge lies in limited consumer awareness and the prevailing preference for vehicle ownership.",https://www.thecore.in/business/maruti-tata-motors-hyundai-betting-car-subscriptions-indians-still-hesitant-4483497?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Following the pandemic, car companies have been anticipating a rise in car subscriptions, which offers an alternative way to access a car. But it has barely scratched 1% of the market so far. In 2020, at the height of a global pandemic, entrepreneur Sakshi Vij?s self-drive rental platform, Myles, launched a car subscription service. It was a bold move, and risky too, but it worked out. ?We got a lot of attention from vehicle manufacturers who were then looking for innovation to be able to sell better,? Vij toldThe Core. At a time when India?s auto industry was facing significant supply chain disruptions and production halts, Myles tied up with Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, MG Motors and others. Since then, the number of cars featured on Myles for subscription has grown by 20-25% annually. They now have 200 fleet partners who list their cars on the platform. Car subscription contributes to over 70% of their business.

The idea behind launching car subscriptions was to offer easy access to cars. Car subscriptions are a lot like leasing but for personal use. Subscribers pay a monthly fee for a certain period (mostly 2-4 years) for using a car. Globally, the subscription model already has a lot of takers and it is being pegged as the next big thing in India. Mobility as a service is a key theme expected in India in the next five years, EY Indias future of mobility leader Som Kapoor told The Core. A younger demographic, aged between 25 and 40, is likely to be the ones adopting car subscriptions, according to Deloittes 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study. India had the largest number of respondents (67%) interested in ditching vehicle ownership for the subscription model. Respondents surveyed were aged between 18-34. Despite this outlook, the actual penetration of car subscriptions currently is very slim. While there is no concrete data, Vij pegs the subscription market in India at about 35,000-40,000 cars. This is barely 1% of the Indian car market, where, on average, 40 lakh cars are sold annually. Indian consumers are still hesitant to adopt the trend for several reasons, including limited awareness, imposed restrictions such as distance caps, and because car ownership is still aspirational in India. Think of it like renting a house. There isnt much difference between personal car leasing and car subscription in India, said Suvajit Karmakar, country managing director of the Indian arm of French car leasing company Ayvens. There are two types of leasing: operational, where you pay a monthly fee until the end of the contract, and financial leasing, which offers the option to buy the product at the end of the term for a pre-decided cost. While corporate car leasing works on the financial model, personal leasing and subscriptions are based on the operational model. In most car subscription models offered in India, a monthly subscription fee includes maintenance, repair, and insurance. This means the leasing company takes care of servicing or maintenance of the car, or in incidental cases such as breakdowns. For instance, Ayvens offers a 24-hour emergency breakdown service in a 100 km periphery of the users residence. One can subscribe to a car directly through the OEMs offering the service, or through third-party platforms like Myles, Ayvens, Orix, and Revv. Most OEMs have partnered with one or more of these third-party platforms. Both Karmakar and Vij said that most of their business comes through these partnerships and not directly. Car subscriptions have been around for some time in India now. Car rental company Revv, which was launched in 2015, started offering subscription-based services in 2018 following an investment by Hyundai. Ayvens started offering private leasing services in the country around seven years ago and launched its pre-leased subscription programme Ugo Subscribe in 2020. Among OEMs, Hyundai and Mahindra & Mahindra started subscription-based services in 2019, and Maruti Suzuki introduced its subscription product in 2020. Tata Motors launched a subscription option for its best-seller, the Tata Nexon EV. Betting big on the trend, Mahindra Finance launched its leasing and subscription business Quiklyz in 2021. While Hyundais cars are still available on several third-party platforms, a Hyundai spokesperson toldThe Core that the company does not offer subscription services anymore. Industry players and observers expect car subscriptions to become more mainstream in the next five years. Vij said that she expects around 10-15% of the Indian car market to switch to subscription-based models towards the end of the decade. Currently, subscription is basically looked at from a taxation [benefit] perspective, Kapoor said. However, he added that in an evolved ecosystem like Europe, people want a three-year car rotation, they dont want the hassle. In other countries, like the UAE, car subscriptions are on the rise as lifestyles become more flexible. Consumers are increasingly more cautious about sustainability, and car subscription and rental companies are putting an effort into that. The global car subscription market crossed US $5 billion in 2022, and is expected to cross US $100 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 35%. Europe currently dominates the global market, accounting for a third of the volume, followed by North America. According to a 2023 Deloitte report on the future of automotive mobility, vehicle use without ownership will make up 57% of the Europe market and 38% of the US market by 2035. Car subscriptions are perfect for a generation of Indians who want a car but dont want the hassle of taking care of it. The flexibility of subscription models is geared towards a younger, more mobile demographic. We are primarily seeing young urban professionals in metros and tier one cities in the age group of 25-45these are individuals at an age group where their growth in income is the highest, Vij said. The flexibility to upgrade your car every two to three years, without worrying about a depreciating asset, is also a key selling point. There is no down payment required, although the subscription fee and the monthly EMI on a car loan are often the same. For instance, the on-road price of a Maruti WagonR LX 1.0L petrol car in Delhi is Rs 6.06 lakh. If you were to opt for a 4-year subscription plan for the car, Maruti Suzuki Subscribe offers the car through its partner Quiklyz at Rs 13,090 per month. If you were to buy the car, the down payment would be about Rs 61,000. Assuming a loan interest rate of 8.5% and a similar 4-year tenure, the monthly EMI would be Rs 13,442. However, this can change when factoring in the cost of maintenance and resale value, which decides the leasing fee for a car. Two cars from different companies costing the same can have different maintenance costs and resale values. The higher the cost of maintenance, the lower its resale value and the more the leasing company will charge you for it. A car could have a much lower lease rental because it has a better resale price and a lower cost of maintenance, whereas a car loan for a car costing Rs 10 lakh will be the same regardless of the brand, Karmakar pointed out. Car subscriptions can be advantageous for carmakers too, allowing more oversight on servicing being conducted at authorised centres and helping retain customers. Changing consumer behaviour during the pandemic  lowered buying sentiment for cars and demand for flexible alternatives  led car manufacturers to foray into subscription services. In a 2020 interview, Hyundai Indias COO Tarun Garg, then director of sales, marketing and services had said that there was a good chance that users would opt for subscription plans over buying a new vehicle in the post-Covid market. While car makers are venturing into subscriptions, the number of takers have been minimal. Maruti Suzuki announced last month that it had hit 10,000 subscribers on Maruti Suzuki Subscribe, its subscription offering, with most users based out of Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Bangalore. Over 50% of them were acquired in FY2023-24, the company said in an official release. The company, Indias largest car maker by volume, offers subscriptions through five partners. Karmakar told The Core that Ayvens pre-leased car subscription offering accounts for less than 4% of the companys total monthly volume. Most of the business comes from the corporate leasing that we do, he said. Another product that the company offers through corporate clients  which is like private leasing but for employees of select companies  contributes to 30% of the companys annual revenue, he said. A 39-year-old user from Bangalore, who requested anonymity, has been leasing a Tata Nexon EV through his company since 2022. He signed up for it during the pandemic, since wait times for a new car were too long, and he was reluctant to use public transport. And I regretted not doing it earlier, he said, touting the income tax benefits the corporate lease offers him. He also had an option to pay a set price at the end of the lease term and buy back the car, which he opted for. But would he have opted to lease a car directly? No. I was interested in that as well, when I was considering this I did some research on subscribing to a car via Quiklyz, but I wasnt getting the same financial benefits I am getting now, he said. Without that, it didnt make sense for him. There are other factors hindering car subscriptions from taking off in India. Most subscription companies offer both new and pre-leased models at different prices. With pre-leased models, the performance can be affected. This shouldnt be a problem, since the company also covers the maintenance and repair costs, but some users have complained of service issues. A US-based user, who also requested anonymity, said that he had opted for a short-term subscription of two months from Revv when visiting India last August. However, the Maruti Swift had already clocked 95,000 km when he got the car, and there was a lot of damage. He struggled to get issues resolved with the companys customer service. Cars in the subscription model also come with a kilometre cap, starting at 10,000 km and increasing according to the plan a user chooses. If a user goes beyond this, there are extra charges. This, and the lack of freedom to customise the car, can also be deterrents. Several potential car owners that The Core spoke to also pointed out that they would much rather own a car if they could afford to pay the EMI/rental fee. Cars, like homes, are still very aspirational in India, there is a lot of value associated with this, a 31-year-old Mumbai-based CA told The Core. Car companies arent very confident about pushing the subscription model yet. For any financial product to actually grow it's very important that the OEMs actually become serious about it, Karmakar said. Kapoor of EY India echoed this. I think a lot of the main players still offer it like a third party service. When they come and do it in-house, from their own stables, that's when I see a true uptick to that business, Kapoor said. The Core reached out to Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra and Volkswagen, as well to platforms Revv, Orix and Quiklyz with queries but did not receive responses at the time of publishing. Following the pandemic, car companies have been anticipating a rise in car subscriptions, which offers an alternative way to access a car. But it has barely scratched 1% of the market so far.",

"Technically, 80% SUVs sold in India are not SUVs at all","SUVs dominate India's car market, constituting every second sale, yet officially accounting for only about a 10th of total sales. Based on GST criteria, SUV sales were 445,556 compared to the 2.13 million claimed by carmakers. Despite not meeting traditional SUV specs, models like Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Hyundai Venue are in high demand, reflecting changing consumer preferences.",https://trak.in/stories/technically-80-of-suvs-sold-in-india-are-not-suvs-at-all/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh Apr 16, 2024 In Indias automotive landscape, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) have emerged as the preferred choice for buyers, constituting every second car sold. Despite their widespread popularity, the official classification of SUVs reveals a stark contrast to their perceived dominance. Official Definition and Sales Disparity According to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Councils definition, an SUV must meet specific criteria, including engine capacity, length, and ground clearance. However, analysis reveals that only a third of the 47 models labeled as SUVs meet these criteria, resulting in a discrepancy between official classification and market perception. Sales Figures and GST Compliance Total car sales in India soared to a record 4.23 million units in the last fiscal year, with SUVs crossing the 50% market-share mark for the first time in FY24. However, when strictly adhering to GST guidelines, SUV sales were significantly lower, standing at 445,556 units compared to the 2.13 million claimed by carmakers. Customer Preference and Tax Savings The allure of SUVs lies in their upright stance, higher driving position, and perceived ruggedness, appealing particularly to younger, image-conscious buyers. Additionally, SUVs offer tax savings under the GST regime, with levies capped at 28% coupled with compensation cess, attracting the highest compensation cess of 22%. Industry Evolution and Changing Preferences SUVs have evolved over the years, adapting to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics. Traditionally associated with off-roading capabilities, SUVs now encompass a broader range of vehicles with varying features and functionalities. This evolution reflects a shift in customer preferences towards urban-centric usage and lifestyle-oriented vehicles. Market Dynamics and Segment Evolution The SUV segment has witnessed significant diversification, with sub-segments emerging to cater to different customer needs and preferences. From compact SUVs like the Maruti Suzuki Brezza to midsize SUVs such as the Hyundai Creta, the market offers a wide range of options to consumers. Future Outlook and Growth Prospects Despite discrepancies between official classification and market perception, the SUV segment is expected to continue its growth trajectory. With increasing urbanization, changing lifestyles, and a slew of new launches in the segment, SUVs are poised to maintain their dominance in Indias automotive landscape. Conclusion While official classification may not fully capture the popularity and diversity of SUVs in India, their widespread appeal and evolving market dynamics underscore their significance in the automotive industry. As consumer preferences evolve and technological advancements continue, the SUV segment is likely to remain a key driver of growth and innovation in the years to come.

As all eyes are on what the billionaire would announce during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and industry leaders, Tesla lovers have only one question: When will they finally be able to drive a 'Make in India', affordable EV? A cheaper Model 3, which is the entry-level Tesla, can only be possible with local manufacturing of battery components and a strong EV supply system, for which Musk will surely have a substantial announcement to make during his maiden visit to the country. Currently, Tesla prices are almost the same worldwide. The base variant of the Model 3 is priced at over $40,000 (nearly Rs 33.5 lakh). According to senior analyst Soumen Mandal from market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research, the import duty will be eliminated by setting up local production by Tesla, thus paving the way for an affordable Tesla car. Also, the cost reduction could be achieved if Tesla cars manufactured in the country come with fewer features compared to the ones available globally. Mandal told IANS that certain hardware required for Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode could be eliminated and Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) Level 2 could be included. Tesla can eventually produce 5 lakh electric vehicles annually that start from Rs 20 lakh in India. To produce a Rs 20 lakh car, Tesla can also have a battery pack with a lower capacity than 50kW and the electric motors could be of lower power. The in-vehicle electronics could also be reduced with a smaller centre display. In the new EV policy, the Indian government has cut the customs duty to 15 per cent (with certain riders) from the earlier 100 per cent on imported cars. A minimum investment of Rs 4,150 crore (about $500 million) will be required to set up the manufacturing facilities for EVs in the country. According to industry experts, Tesla can generate at least $3.6 billion in revenue in India by 2030.

Tamil Nadu to pitch for all opportunities: Rajaa on Tesla plans,"Tamil Nadu's Industries Minister TRB Rajaa said the state ""will be pitching for all opportunities of electric vehicle manufacturing from all global car majors"". He remarked on being asked about Tamil Nadu's plans for attracting Tesla to set up a plant in the state. Tamil Nadu has India's ""best electric vehicle policies and ecosystem"", Rajaa stated.",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/india-s-tamil-nadu-state-to-pull-out-all-stops-to-attract-musk?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) --  Indias southern state of Tamil Nadu will aggressively pitch itself as a manufacturing site for Tesla Inc. as speculation builds about the US companys planned investments ahead of billionaire Elon Musks visit. Tamil Nadu will be pitching for all opportunities of electric vehicle manufacturing from all global car majors, T. R. B Rajaa, the states minister for industries said, when asked if Tesla was on his radar. He added that the province, often called the Detroit of India for its automaking prowess, has countrys best electric vehicle policies and ecosystem. Teslas Chief Executive Officer is set to visit India and meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whos seeking a third term in office in federal elections starting later this month. Luring investment from the EV giant will bolster Modis credentials  as well as the states where any plant may be set up  as being business friendly and in favor of creating jobs. Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu, is wooing Tesla considering its already home to the manufacturing facilities of Nissan Motor Co., Renault SA, Hyundai Motor Co. and BMW AG and the auto parts supply chains that feed them. But itll face stiff competition from other Indian states that are also petitioning Musk. Tesla has been weighing setting up an EV plant in India but hasnt made any firm commitment. The worlds third-biggest greenhouse gas emitter is seeking to decarbonize its economy and turn net zero by 2070. India, which is also the worlds most populous nation, is seen as a potential new growth driver for Tesla as electric car sales growth in China and the US wavers. Demand for EVs in India, by contrast, is still on the rise. India also cut the import duty on EVs last month and said to get tax concessions, foreign companies will have to invest at least 41.5 billion rupees ($500 million) and start producing EVs from a local plant within three years. Tamil Nadu is already the automotive capital of the country, said Rajaa. Now we will aim at making the state the EV capital too.

Viral Video: Navigating the bustling streets of India is no easy feat, especially behind the wheel of a multi-crore supercar. And when fellow drivers show a reluctance to adhere to traffic norms, chaos can quickly ensue, often resulting in accidents caused by sheer carelessness. In a recent incident capturing widespread attention on Instagram, a pricey Lamborghini Huracan worth over Rs 3.72 crore unexpectedly encountered a Honda Activa rider. The viral video showcases the vibrant red sports car gracefully manoeuvring a turn, stealing the spotlight until an approaching white Activa enters the frame. Initially appearing under control, the Activa abruptly veers closer to the Lamborghini, a move that could have led to a disastrous outcome. It seems to be a reaction to a patch of sand on the road. Despite the Lamborghini owner's quick attempts to swerve and avoid collision, the inevitable bump occurs, sending both vehicles into a momentary frenzy. The video, captured by a biker trailing behind and shared by the Lamborghini owner, has not just gained traction but has become a social media sensation on Instagram, accumulating over 2.37 lakh likes in a short span of time. Such incidents underscore the importance of adhering to traffic regulations and maintaining awareness of one's surroundings. Additionally, practising patience and staying composed while driving is crucial for maintaining control over one's vehicle.  Lamborghini Huracan| Wikipedia Furthermore, the Activa rider's disregard for wearing a helmet, as observed in the video, serves as a stark reminder of the potentially fatal consequences of flouting safety measures.

Simply put, it is a new avatar having the sub-4 meter compact SUV loaded with all the contemporary bells and whistles which are expected in a vehicle in this segment to have now. As we already know that the sub-4 meter compact SUV segment is a heavily crowded space so far. Presently, this segment is dominated by the likes of the Tata Nexon and the Maruti Suzuki Brezza. The segment has other players too including the Maruti Suzuki Fronx, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet. All these models are showcased among the largest-selling in the industry. If we look closely into numbers, the Tata Nexon registered wholesales of 171,697 units, the Maruti Suzuki Brezza of 169,897 units, the Maruti Suzuki Fronx of 134,735 units, the Hyundai Venue of 124,307 units and the Kia Sonet of 81,384 units in FY24.

Further, it highlights vertically-stacked headlamp units with LED DRLs and LED connected tail lamp units of this updated model. This lineup is also graced by new 16-inch alloys as well.

Besides this, it has also got a new touchscreen infotainment system and automatic climate control unit. It comes with front ventilated seats, even its steering wheel looks new. The XUV3XO comes with a panoramic sunroof, making it the first model in its segment to get this feature. As we know that the other sub-4 meter compact SUVs have a standard electric sunroof. It is already known that the present Mahindra XUV300 performed handsomely in the Global NCAP crash tests. It has secured a full five stars in the adult occupant protection category and four stars in the child occupant protection category. Now, we are expecting the same with the all new Mahindra XUV3XO to have high safety standards with features like all four disc brakes, six airbags, 360-degree camera and electronic stability control, among others.

A jury trial was to start next week in a wrongful death suit that accused Tesla of not living up to its marketing when it came to driver-assistance and safety technology in its cars. Court documents filed Monday said Tesla and the family of Wei Lun Huang had reached a settlement, and that Tesla is asking the amount involved remain under seal. Huang believed that Model X technology would eliminate risk of harm to the driver ""caused by the vehicle failing to drive at safe speeds, failing to operate only within marked travel lanes, failing to avoid other vehicles or obstacles while driving on highways, or accelerating into fixed objects or vehicles while in autopilot mode,"" the original complaint contended. Huang was traveling along a highway in the California city of Mountain View in March of 2018 using an autopilot feature when the Model X drove into a concrete median, fatally injuring him, according to the lawsuit. Huang's family argued in filings that Tesla was negligent and careless in building and marketing the 2017 Model X. US regulators determined that Huang did not have his hands on the steering wheel at the time of the accident, despite alerts from the Autopilot driver assistance software to do so. Tesla has stood by the safety of its cars and Autopilot features, which it has warned do not free drivers from paying attention.

Pune now has more two-wheelers than entire population,"Pune grapples with a surge in vehicle registrations as the total number of two-wheelers is now more than the entire population as per 2011 census. With motorcycles and cars dominating the roads, there's a growing need to enhance public transport services to reduce reliance on private vehicles. Efforts are on to mitigate pollution through technology upgrades and green fuel initiatives.",https://trak.in/stories/pune-now-has-more-two-wheelers-than-total-population/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Rohit Kulkarni Apr 09, 2024 A substantial number of increase in the number of vehicles registered in the city has been revealed by the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO). Signifying a substantial rise in the vehicle ownership, the total has reached to 47,24,961, which surpasses the population count recorded in the 2011 Census. A Looming Threat to Infrastructure and Environment The number spells doom and has aggravated the infrastructure challenges and environmental concerns and has exacerbated the traffic congestion. Sanjeev Bhore, RTO official highlighted the unprecedented surge in vehicle registrations. Out of the total numbers, motorcycles form the majority with 34,66,987, this is followed by cars which stand at 8,45,526. Further inundating the Pune roads and leading to daily gridlocks across the city are auto-rickshaws (14,700) and cabs (46,335). Director of Climate Collective Pune Environmental Foundation, Vaishali Patkar, emphasised the need to improve the public transport facilities. Highlighting the foundations repetitive urge to authorities regarding the improvement in public transport, she said that For the past 10 years, we have continuously urged authorities like the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Urban Development Department, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML), and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMDRA) to enhance public transport services. If public transport is enhanced, citizens will be less inclined to opt for private vehicles. Challenges & Impacts of Rising Private Vehicle Numbers Underscoring the rise in private vehicle numbers as well as the menace that it poses, Senior Programme Director at the Centre for Environment Education, Dr Sanskriti Menon said that Congestion not only leads to lost time but also stress and road rage. Air pollution from vehicle emissions poses serious health risks, affecting various organs beyond the respiratory system. Moreover, the citys reliance on private vehicles hampers inclusivity, making navigation difficult for children, elderly, women, and people with disabilities. Further highlighting the adverse impact of road widening initiatives which include chopping off of trees, she said that Widening roads and building flyovers attract more private vehicles, worsening congestion. This approach also compromises pedestrian safety, with footpaths and cycle tracks being sacrificed for road expansion. One overlooked element that is being impacted is the impacted groundwater. She added that One more impact, which is not evident, is the rise in vehicle numbers also impacting groundwater. These 47 lakh bikes and cars also need to be parked somewhere. Advanced Center for Water Resources Development and Management (ACWADAM), an organisation working on groundwater management, has cautioned that the new buildings are being built with two or three floors underground, and such excavation has depleted groundwater levels across the city. While acknowledging the impact of increased vehicle numbers, the Environment Officer at PMC, Manesh Dighe pointed out one positive aspect that the vehicles manufactured with BS6 technology, produce less pollution. He said that Old vehicles will be phased out over time, and PMPMLs focus on green fuel for buses, such as CNG or electric vehicles, is a step towards mitigating pollution.

So why a theme like this (for your book), and what brought you to this theme, and then what made you write about it? I've been asked to write books on what I did or what happened during my tenure in different companies, but I've been extremely reluctant to do that because I don't want to write about that. Then, about four years ago, somebody told me, why don't you write about your learnings? That made me pause, and I said, okay, why not? Then he suggested, that you always test the limits, why don't you think about testing the limits? And that was the first cue. Second cue, I got was, again, another close friend, a business associate. I asked him how do you think you described my way of working? And thought for a minute, then he said: Ravi, you lead from the back. And that's when the penny dropped. And I said, okay, so let me go back. What does it mean? Because he was from advertising, I had huge respect for him. I went back and deconstructed the entire thing of what leading from the back means.  I went back to my 50 years of experience, and then I culled out three basic, simple truths. One about myself. First, because you have to talk about yourself, then it is how to build a team. And number three is how together you tackle the task. Because ultimately, as a corporate person, you have to tackle a task. In each of these three, there are three simple things, again, but very difficult to implement. In the first one, what do I do with myself? The first is to have an open mind. Number two is to take ownership. And number three is to be detached. Sometimes it may seem contradictory. We'll talk about it later. About the teambuild trust, be collaborative, leverage strengths. And for tasks, test the limits, look outside, and act up softly. The question was, how do I make it happen? Then somebody suggested it's good for a parable. And that also set me thinking: okay, what does it mean? I was writing a serious book. I went through some of the books and parables. I said, that's very interesting because my target group was mid-level managers and I wanted it to be a low-priced book so that people wouldn't think twice about buying the book, although it was a somewhat difficult topic. That's how it came. Let me begin sequentially. You said first is what do I do with myself? What part, or rather where in your career did you pose that question to yourself first in which, let's say, organisation or task that you were faced with?  When we were going to bidding for, Daewoo Group, South Korea. They don't speak English. An English-speaking mid-level manager was assigned to us. I was standing in the anteroom of the president, just with them, just the two of us. And I thought, as we are doing the due diligence and we want to take over the company, but we are not taking an innate company. We are not taking a piece of machinery. We are taking living organisms. And therefore we must know how these people perceive us or what they want. I asked him, who do you think you would like to go with? And he said that we would like to go with a European company. I asked him why. And he said that because it will ensure our career, it will ensure our future because we will get technology, we will get this thing, which if you were a closed mind, you would say, no, what the hell? He doesn't know me. If you are full of ego, you will say, he doesn't know me. And why is he saying this? But with an open mind. if you think about it, then you feel that what he is saying is right, because he needs to protect his career, he needs to protect his future. And that one sentence made the whole difference, in our whole approach to taking over. We got everything translated into Korean. We took appointments with all from the president, trade minister, governor, everybody else, and we informed them, told them, look, as Korea had made tremendous progress in technology and in business and all that, but they were lacking in one thing, corporate governance. And Tatas has been doing corporate governance for over 100 years. We had to teach them something, as we were to take something. And the other thing is, Tata Motors was into R&D (research and development), and into well connected worldwide with various things that changed the whole tone. And when my team was coming back after due diligence, they became emotional and said, if the company was to go to anybody, it must go to Tatas. It was not (about) the money that we were offering. It was the way we acted with them with a very open mind, that changed everything, and actually made us win the pitch. And later, or soon later, you were to acquire Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which was, of course, iconic in very different circumstances. How did a similar situation play out there as well? The template was the same. What was our template in South Korea? Our template was: Be a South Korean company in South Korea, not an Indian company in South Korea. It's a subtle difference, but a huge difference. That means you are seeing yourself as part of that scenario, not as somebody going from here and acquiring. You are part of them, and you are therefore looking at the well-being of people. You are looking at the well-being of society. That's the Tata ethos. And we applied exactly the same template here (Jaguar) also. Here also, we had a very tough problem because the union was very strong, and they were supposed to be leaning towards some others. We had a three-hour confrontation, not a confrontation, but a very tough discussion. They came with an eleven-page or twelve-page questionnaire, and they kept asking questions, and it was eyeball to eyeball. Answers, answers, answers. After all this was over, then my colleague said: Sir, it has gone very tough. I don't think it is going to happen. But something inside me told me that, no, I think we have been very honest, very transparent, and they will accept us. And lo and behold, two days later, they went to a press conference. They said the company must go to the Tatas. What I'm trying to say is, that it is this kind of attitude that can win over people and which can make things happen and get extraordinary results. Intuitively, JLR is a company with globally iconic automobile brands. From India Tata Motors is better known at that time, at least, as a commercial vehicle manufacturer. There's no real synergy. As people Tatas are great, but they're only known in India and not outside. What is it that was the clinching point in at least those interactions that you had?  Just taking your point a little further. The president of the dealer association in the US called us a tandoori chicken company, and he said, how can a tandoori chicken company take over iconic brands like this? But we found various things, which I think many people were not aware of, and I'll list out four or five things. Number one is, although they were not known for quality, I think our predecessor had spent a lot of money and made the manufacturing quality very good. And therefore the products which are going to come out were going to be of high quality. Then their engineering was very strong, and their style was very strong. And the kind of products we saw in the pipeline, we were very enthused that not only what was going to come in the next year, but over the next four or five years, it was strong. And because they were strong in engineering, they could continue to give. The third thing, we found out was that even though the dealers were under stress, their loyalty to the brand was amazing. I have never seen in my life that kind of brand loyalty, that the dealers had for the Jaguar and Range Rover brand. And I thought, if this is the case, and if we were to combine some strengths from Tatas, like our focus on cost and our focus on consumer orientation, then we can make a very powerful thing. I think that's what we discussed. Mr (Ratan) Tata was of course here very involved. And he's the one who suggested that we should look at it. And finally, of course, it all happened. And Mr Tata and I and some other people went around the US meeting dealers. We must have met scores of dealers. And at the end of the day, people understood who Tatas was, because Mr Tata himself was personifying the group. The same person, the Tandoori chicken person, became a best friend. What I'm trying to say is, while cut and dried, things are fine and they should happen. But I think success depends a lot on other things, the soft issues, how you behave with people, how you deal with people and that kind of thing. The second point you talked about is building the team either for a task or a company as a whole. But I'm assuming, since you've always been with mature businesses, it could be more sort of fresh teams or renewed teams, or for certain tasks. What are the examples that stand out the most to you as you look back? I worked in seven companies, each in a different industry, and of which I had no knowledge therefore, how do I succeed? From scooter company to Phillips, from Phillips to Tata Motors, and before that, Titan watches or Hawkins pressure cookers. With some stroke of luck, I got into the new company, but I have no knowledge of it. How do I do? What do I do then? I went alone. I did not go with the coterie of my people, because by going alone, I'm giving them the signal that I am trusting you. I have not brought my trusted people along with me, whom I'm going to trust. That's how we built trust. The main thing was building trust. It takes time. Some people begin to understand you in three months and say, okay, this guy is okay. Some people will take years, some people will take two years. Some people may not trust you at all, but you have to take that chance. But once you build that trust, they are building a very strong foundation, because then trust leads to collaboration, a strong collaboration. And if you identify people's strengths, so you can understandtaking people's strengths, individual people's strengths, in a collaborative manner, where there's trust pervading, you are making for a very powerful organisation. And you may be thinking that, okay, I'll go from here to there, but this organisation can go from here to there. That is the difference. In the case of Tata Motors, when you joined, these big acquisitions were still a little away. At that time, it was more about launching, let's say, Nano, which didn't do that well, and Indica or Indigo, which already, came, I think, a little later. But these were existing. But Tata has already transitioned from commercial vehicles to passenger vehicles. Was just transitioning. What were the kinds of challenges, then? From the outside, it seemed like a lot of people felt that Tatas would not succeed in the passenger vehicle because they said for decades, it's only built commercial vehicles, many of them out of Jamshedpur, some from Pune, and so on. Let me go back a little, because I became the CEO of the company a little later, in 2005, I think. For the first six years, I was only in commercial vehicles, looking after commercial workers. That time, unfortunately, the market tanked. And, commercial vehicles have very close connections with the economy and therefore the commercial vehicle market tanked. But in that market itself, we were able to maintain our market share. Of course, we turned in our first loss in the company's history. And that's the kind of thing I confronted or I was faced with when I joined the company. And therefore, how do you make the turnaround? And of course, several things were done. Cost reduction was one of the key ones. Then new products and changing other things. So many things in marketing and all that. We were able to convert a Rs 500 crore loss into a Rs 500 crore profit in just two years. That was a fantastic thing. And that's how people came together because successful companies also have a lot of egos. People say, no, it can't happen, but it happened to them and therefore you challenge them. Now it has happened. Now let's pull up our socks and do something as a team. And things happened and we came out of the woods and we made a gain. Then another big thing happened: the introduction of Ace. We don't talk about that. But Ace created a new market, equivalent to the existing commercial vehicle market. That is how big that transformation was, Ace. It was a roaring success. Ace, for those who don't know, would be a small truck, right?  A mini truck. It's the last mile of connectivity, whether for urban areas or rural areas. And it exceeded all our expectations. We were flabbergasted by the success of this. We had not thought it would succeed. Where did the idea for Ace come from?  Number of places because one thing was there at that time. Mr VajpayeesPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana was ongoing and therefore these (roads) were getting connected. Rural areas and urban areas were getting congested. Then somebody suggested, why don't you have this kind of vehicle? We put together a team and they went around the country. They looked at three-wheelers because this need was being met by three-wheelers. They looked at the need, they came up with a fantastic product called Ace. And again, Tata Motors had this huge reservoir of talent. As far as low price is concerned, the economy is concerned. They came up with this beautiful thing and we launched it. We launched it first in Tamil Nadu. We sorted out all the problems. I remember we launched in Tamil Nadu and it was called Chhota Hathi. What do you call in Tamil? Chinna (Yannai?). It became a roaring success. And we started doing 600 a month. And then somebody said, no, it's not going to sell more and all that. We said, nothing doing, in India, there's no such thing as can't be doing more. We again challenged ourselves, and we reached a level of almost 1,850 per month, just one product in Tamil Nadu, which was our weakest market. As you know, our competitor had a very strong market. Ashok Leyland.  Yeah, yeah. We did very well and then slowly expanded to the entire south India. And then we took almost 9-10 months to cover the entire country. And that model continues today in roughly the same form and shape. With some innovations. It's got variance. It's got variance for the upper side, lower side, horizontal, and all that. We built a whole new plant in Uttarakhand for Ace. Ace was a success. And you were saying the transitioning to passenger vehicles. Tell us about the team factor that was playing there. I think the person who spearheaded the Ace project was asked to also spearhead, now the Nano project. Unfortunately, it didn't succeed. But as far as innovation is concerned, it is kind of unheard of. It is almost impossible to work backward that, okay, it must cost Rs 1 lakh then work backward. And if there was an imaginary car, what would be the different component prices? That's how we started from a white sheet of paper, and then the engineering team kind of looked at it very seriously. We talked to our suppliers. Suppliers played a very key role in that and making it happen. And after that, we did several things, and therefore, it came out after seven years in a different form. I think it's a tribute to the organisation, a tribute to the excellence of Tata Motors, especially the engineering team. If I were to just build on that for a moment, if you were to apply those lessons today to any company, including in, automotive, we're seeing so many brand launches, so many variations. What would be the lesson from Nano from then, which we can apply now, as in the good and the bad? I think the first lesson is to not think that anything is impossible, and you need to therefore work methodically and talk to people. And once you set yourself, as in the third part, test the limit. This is testing the limits of making a car at Rs 1,00,000. How do you make it happen? As I said, we had a white sheet exercise. This is the selling price. Then come back. This will be excise duty on that. Come back. This is the bill of materials, say 70% of that. And if this is the bill of material, what should the cost of tyres be, what should the cost of the engine, what should the sheet metal cost? And then you go and say, if I have to make an engine at this price, what do I need to do? That forces you to innovate. I mean, for innovation. I don't think there's any parallel in the car industry as far as Nano is concerned. It forces you to innovate, it forces you to collaborate, and it forces you to go outside the box. And I think that's what is needed. The x-factor was missing, which is why it was not successful either because of the looks, the marketing, or the branding. I think the looks were good. I've still not been able to put my finger on it. The advertising brought lakhs of people into the showrooms, lakhs of people. And out of that, at least 50% of people took test drives. It was quite amazing. And many people out of that put in money, but after that, they didn't come back. Because there were other models at slightly higher prices. I don't know. That's why I'm saying I've not been able to put a finger at it. As I said, we were very tough as far as cost was concerned, but of course we took care of people. The other thing in Nano, which I think is truly remarkable, which has not happened anywhere in the world, is we have built a complete factory in West Bengal. At the last minute, we had to make a very tough decision to move it out from there. We were moving 1,300 kilometers to the opposite side in Gujarat. On one side you are dismantling a factory bolt by bolt, machine by machine, packing it up in a container. Another side you are building another factory to take all that. On the third side, we converted part of our plant in Uttarakhand, which we had built for Ace, into making Nano. And that's how we started making Nano in small quantities. I don't think has ever happened. And it is again attributed to the team, to Tata Motors' tenacity and not giving up on anything and to have made it happen. If you would say today, just looking back who was missing in that room when suppose you had the whole team of people who designed the Nano, who are very good at, let's say, managing costs, logistics, bringing down prices, and of course, let's say the challenge of then moving the plant because of political reasons. But who would you say, in retrospect, was missing in that room? I can't think of that. But ultimately, you know, it was Mr Tata's idea that he would like to make a car at that price. Which apparently was influenced by CK Prahlad's (Fortune At The) Bottom of the Pyramid. Whatever, I am not going into all that. But he had thought of this in Geneva and he disclosed this a few years earlier in Geneva. And Mr Tata was very involved in this whole thing as to what should be the shape, what should be this thing. He used to personally come, frequently come to Pune, drive the cars in various things, see the thing, have the presentation, very involved in creating. But as I said, I'm not able to put a finger on it. But, someone was missing, you feel. I don't know how someone was missing Or if you were to contrast it with, let's say, the success of Ace or maybe some of the other passenger cars later. Yeah, it is the X-factor, which you may call, things about which you can't explain. And sometimes some things happen beyond your expectations. You are working the same thing, you are doing the same thing, some things are beyond your expectations, some things are below your expectations and that's what has happened. InLeading from the Back, you also talk about teams. That's the third factor. How do you bring together a team and the task, the assembling of the team is one thing, and then making sure that the team converges towards a task and usually an impossible task. In Nanos context, it appears to me that you had no competition except your own, let's say, will do it at a certain point in time and make and take it to the market. How does that happen? I mean, again, instances that you can lean back on where teams have come together, in some cases may be led from the back for impossible tasks. Turnaround of Tata Motors. The first one was impossible, very difficult. Then putting Cummins engines at the top of the heap as far as commercial vehicles are concerned. Then the introduction of Ace, the introduction of Nano, and the acquisition of a truck company for the first time in South Korea where people are very nationalistic, people don't speak English, and are very proud of themselves, to go and make a success of that. Or then to Jaguar Land Rover. Everywhere it's the team. Everywhere is the team. If you have a good team, if the people are very honest, people are very transparent, there's no kind of politics and all that within the group and all are moving towards one direction and you have support from the top boss, Mr Tata, then I said, nothing is impossible. That is one thing I've learned from Mr Tata, to think big and bold. I could never have imagined that we'd be making such decisions. It is, I would say the sheer influence or sheer support from Mr Tata, that one was able to decide because if things went wrong, you are still going to be there doing something. And that's how Tata Motors went from 1.9 when I joined the company, a 1.6 or 1.7 billion company to a $39 billion company in the span of 15 years. If the company had not taken such bold decisions, we wouldn't be here. One of those decisions was to become a global company, which also was sort of facilitated by the time, mid-2000s to the end-2000s. The rupee was strong, and Indian companies were acquiring overseas. The ecosystem was favourable. But that also requires taking bets. And at that time it felt that, okay, let's go outside. What were the kind of different kind of views and how did the teams come together? At that time Tata Motors was only into commercial vehicles, and commercial vehicles are a very cyclical business. It goes up 40%, goes down 70%, and this is the nature of the beast, so to say. And not only in India, but worldwide. Therefore, if you wanted to reduce the cyclicality, you needed to also put some things which were less cyclical. And that's how Ace came because smaller commercial vehicles are less cyclical and there's some phase difference and go international, go into the car business. This is all part of the same strategy, that if you were to have combined all this, then the whole company would be less cyclical, and therefore you wouldn't have to go through what happened in 1999. That was one of the things. And because you have a strong resource base in Tata Motors, in people, I think that's the biggest thing. And you have a kind of strong leadership which Mr Tata provided into really thinking big. And that gave me a lot of encouragement. And we put young people, I mean, for example, we took out young people and put them in charge of Ace. The whole team and did fantastically well. We also put a young team in Nano. We also sent a mid-level team to do this thing, due diligence, and all that for Daweoo and this thing. I would say if you give people freedom, if you look at their competencies and strengths, and give them opportunities, I have seen that nine out of ten times it works. And Tata Motors today, for example, let's say, has 80% of the EV (electric vehicle) market, it is spinning off as a separate company, and so on. Would you say that what you saw then, and were also maybe setting up and the kind of team structures and so on, is also responsible for what we are seeing today? Sure. I think the current leadership of Tata Motors, whether it is the chairman (N Chandrasekaran) or Shailesh Chandra (managing director at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd), they have taken a big bet that electrification is the way. And if and whenever markets change, when the trend changes, then if you position yourself strongly, you have a great benefit because you can go with the wave. And that's what Tata Motors did. They have taken the first step, absolute clarity, no hesitation, and they're putting in a lot of resources as far as design, quality, everything is concerned. And that's how they have taken the lead and they want to grow the electric market. There may be other problems, other things, and all that. And they are always naysayers in society. There are always people saying, this should not be done, this thing India can't afford. But my personal view is that India cannot afford several technologies. We don't have the benefit of that luxury. And therefore, India should choose one and put all resources and just move forward. When you say different, do you mean hydrogen and others? So many things, so many other electric, I don't want to name, but it fritters away energy. It fritters away the focus. It fritters away. Can you imagine that the same model is there in four variants? You have to have procurement, you have to have manufacturing, you have to store them, you have to have dealers. People don't understand this, but a manufacturer understands this, and therefore, you're making things very complicated. That's all I'm trying to say. And therefore, with a single-minded focus and purpose, if you go ahead, which I think Tata Motors is doing, it's fantastic. If they move forward like this. The point that you made is that catching the trend, catching the trend. And you feel that today, whether you use the leading from the back or assembling teams in general, of course, successful companies by definition must be. But in general, do you feel companies are aligned well, to spot trends, to respond fast to them? I'm talking about India now specifically. I don't want to generalise, but you will see umpteen examples where people who have caught the trend have benefited immensely. I'll give one example of where I've been. Titan Watches, for example. Titan watch has done fantastic things. But one of the key things, which aided Titan Watches then was they caught the trend at the right time for watches, for quartz watches. I was there only for five years, for quartz watches. And because it was heavily dominated by mechanical watches, as you know, HMT was the king with 85-90% market share. Then Titan took the bold risk of being only in quartz watches because there was a trend of people already becoming fashion conscious, and therefore they were already into multiple watch ownership, which were being fed by smuggled watches and things like that. And therefore it caught the trend at the right time and went ahead. And you know, what happened to HMT watches later on. Later on, of course, Titan went into other retail things like jewellery and various other things. I don't want to comment, but then, because it took the bold risk, it caught the trend at the right time, and it went up. And you're also saying that, in a way, put many eggs in one basket, like whether it's in the case of electric today, or Ace at that time, or Nano, and then, let's say quartz in the case of Titan, and then for every company will have something. But don't go with five different products and try. And so catching the trend is an important thing. I mean, there are so many market researches done, whether it's qualitative, quantitative, this thing, that thing, so many things are there. I think you need to look at all that. And with that, you need to add your gut feeling. I think the gut feeling is very important in business in trying to catch the trend, kya ho raha hai, kya nahi ho raha hai (what is happening, what is not happening), that kind of thing. Let me ask you then, two questions. One time, at any time, where you felt that you were strong on your gut, but it didn't turn out as well. And the second, where, again, you relied on your gut, but things turned out well. One was, of course, I'll take Hawkins. Hawkins is a great company. I learned my marketing at Hawkins. We were selling pressure cookers. Then we thought of coming into electrical products, and we had two fantastic products. One was an infrared cooker. Quick time in two minutes, three minutes, you'll cook. The other is a slow cooker, put it overnight. Both are fantastic products, quality-wise, look-wise, performance-wise. We did many things. Many, many things. It didn't succeed. We had to finally close down. Hawkins had to close down. I felt very bad because there were very good products, extremely supported by marketing and sales and everything, but didn't work. Because perhaps the market was not ready, the consumers were not ready to go for that. But today, you see so many slow cookers in the market. There's no dearth of them, maybe they'll come back again with this. I don't know. But I'm talking about 25 years. It was way ahead of that time. We used to see Panasonic and those brands. I think it was way ahead of time, that's all I'm saying. And therefore, perhaps had become maybe ten years later, we would have got it in a better fashion. That's one, let's say things didn't work out. And on the other hand, where something you feel you were bang on. Titan. Titan Quartz is a fantastic example. The success of LML is again, a fantastic example of how people were used to one type of product. Bajaj Chetak. One type of scooter. I won't name, so scooters. And because I was coming from Titan Watches into LML, I could see the consumer was already changing. And therefore, can you add some bells and whistles and frizz and things like that, upgrade it a little, and make it a little more aspirational. And lo and behold what happens. A 9% market share turns into 32% in a very intensive, competitive, dominant industry. Can you imagine? Because we were able to catch the trend, we were able to do it. Not because you have to do certain things, no question of that. But if you are able to catch the trend, then your success is far greater than you can ever imagine. Given India's constraints, a company cannot afford to spread its resources across multiple technologies, Kant said.",

Industry experts believe subsidies such as cash incentives are crucial to India hitting its goal of electrifying 70% of its two-wheeler fleet by 2030, as the world's third-largest importer of oil looks to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. ""We've been able to cut down a lot of subsidy reliance, but it's also come at the cost of almost a year's worth of lost growth,"" Ather CEO and co-founder Tarun Mehta said in an interview. Mehta was referring to the government's surprise decision in May to slash cash incentives for e-scooters to a maximum of 15% of the purchase price before tax from 40% previously. India's e-scooter market is small but growing, accounting for 5% of total two-wheeler sales in fiscal 2023-2024. Ather was one of the first to drive the pick-up in adoption with the launch of its 450 series of e-scooters in 2018, but has fallen behind larger rivals Ola Electric and TVS Motor, whose discounts have driven sales. Ather, which counts India's biggest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp as its largest investor, launched a new, ""family-friendly"" e-scooter called ""Rizta"" on Saturday, priced at 109,999 rupees ($1,321). The scooter has a larger seat and storage space compared with rivals. Mehta hopes it will attract a wider range of buyers in India's populous north and west regions, helping boost sales. Loss-making Ather is focusing on top-line growth, Mehta said, but added margins would improve if sales volumes were higher. ""We haven't broken even yet, I think there's still a journey, hopefully it's not very long.

Tesla asks Apple to help prove driver killed in crash was gaming,"Tesla has obtained Apple executive James Harding's sworn statement that proves that Apple ex-engineer Walter Huang was using his iPhone when his Tesla EV, running on Autopilot, crashed in 2018. Huang's family sued Tesla, claiming that Autopilot technology was flawed. According to court filings, Harding's statement says Apple determined that Huang was actively playing a game when his EV crashed.",https://tech.hindustantimes.com/amp/tech/news/elon-musk-is-asking-apple-to-help-in-tesla-crash-lawsuit-details-71712398500429.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"In an effort to strengthen its case in a heated lawsuit over the safety of its Autopilot system, Tesla is looking to Apple for help. The case, which stems from a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model X in 2018, resulted in a legal battle over the circumstances of the accident. The incident happened when the car, running in Autopilot mode, crashed with a safety barrier on US Highway 101 in Mountain View, California, killing Wei ""Walter"" Huang, a former Apple engineer. Huang's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that the Autopilot technology was flawed and contributed to the incident, reported9to5mac. Also read: Tesla Cybertruck owner takes Apple Vision Pro on a drive! Know what happened On the other side, Tesla claims that Huang was distracted by his iPhone while driving, especially playing a game at the time of the accident. However, data retrieved from Huang's phone by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was inconclusive as to whether he was actively using his cellphone at the time of the disaster. Tesla now aims to strengthen its case by enlisting the assistance of Apple, Huang's previous employer. The electric carmaker hopes to use Apple data analysis to prove that Huang was using his iPhone at the time of the deadly incident. According to court filings, Tesla has obtained a sworn statement from James Harding, an Apple engineering manager, who examined telemetry data from Huang's phone. Harding's investigation reveals that there may have been some user contact during the incident, such as screen touches or button pushes. However, disagreements have emerged between Tesla and Apple around the sharing of sensitive information. While Tesla seeks greater cooperation from Apple, the tech giant has refused to disclose any information, citing concerns over the leaking of confidential material. The upcoming trial, scheduled to commence next week in San Jose, is expected to delve into the issues of liability in accidents involving autonomous driving technology. With the study scheduled to last two months, the results might have far-reaching consequences for the future development and regulation of such sophisticated vehicle technologies. Tesla's request for proof from Apple highlights the complexities of the legal dispute over the Autopilot disaster, highlighting concerns about accountability and duty in the area of self-driving vehicles.

"Never burn cash, don't sell cheap with discounts: Kant to EV firms","G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant addressed Indian EV makers at an event and said, ""Never burn cash to sell your product [and] don't sell cheap with discounts."" ""Build a top-class engineered product...be the pride of Make in India and be a global brand,"" he stated. Combustion engine technology based on fossil fuels is ""dead"" and the future is electric, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ice-is-dead-technology-india-should-grab-global-ev-markets-says-g20-sherpa-amitabh-kant-12587571.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Amitabh Kant, the G20 sherpa and former CEO of NITI Aayog, said that the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is a 'dead technology' and the way forward is electric, pushing for EV makers to make India the biggest manufacturer and exporter of electric vehicles. ""We are the biggest exporter of two-wheelers in the world, ICE is a dead technology according to me and the market is disrupted with EVs and that is why players like Ather should not just make for India but for the world, "" Kant said during a key note address at Ather's community day event held in Bengaluru on April 6. Kant also pushed for Indian EV players to make electric two-wheelers for the global market. ""It is the mindset of entrepreneurs. India is a large market but we do not realise that export market gives 5X more of what you get in India. Everytime India has grown it has grown because of exports, "" He said. He added that by 2030 the whole world will move only be electric and India must grab that opportunity. Kant's words come at a time when the central government has reduced the budget allocation for the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicle (FAME) scheme by nearly 44 percent to Rs 2,671 crore for FY25, which may result in a slowdown in the adoption of electric vehicles in India. In FY24, the government allocated a revised estimate of nearly Rs 4,807 crore for FAME schemes, according to the governments budget allocation document published on February 1, 2024. MakeEV-centric curriculum Talking of skilling within the EV industry, Kant saidthe Centrehas worked with around 20 IITs and IIITs on electric mobility courses within the institutions. ""We need data scientists, product developers, prompt engineers and many institutions should change their curriculum based on this,"" he said. Sharing some advice to EV makers, Kant said the manufacturers should not 'burn cash' by selling products at a cheaper cost with low-quality. ""Never burn cash by selling your vehicles by compromising on quality... Create a brand for an aspirational middle-class Indian, "" he signed off.",
"Tesla to unveil robotaxi in August, says Musk","Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on August 8, CEO Elon Musk said. The announcement came amid reports of Tesla scrapping plans for a less-expensive electric vehicle, which was expected to be in the range of $25,000. Musk previously said that with full self-driving, Tesla owners could earn money in future by operating their cars as taxis when not in use.",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-unveil-robotaxi-on-aug-8?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. plans to unveil its long-promised robotaxi later this year as the electric carmaker struggles with weak sales and competition from cheap Chinese EVs. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk posted Friday on X, his social media site, that Teslas robotaxi will be unveiled on Aug. 8. Shares gained as much as 5.1% in postmarket trading in New York. Teslas stock has fallen 34% this year through Fridays close. Shortly before Musk posted the news about the robotaxi, he lost the title of third-richest person in the world to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Inc. A fully autonomous vehicle, pitched to investors in 2019, has long been key to Teslas lofty valuation. In recent weeks, Tesla has rolled out the latest version of the driver-assistance software that it markets as FSD, or Full Self-Driving, to consumers. The company has said that its next-generation vehicle platform will include both a cheaper car and a dedicated robotaxi. Though the company has teased both, it has yet to unveil prototypes of either. Musks Friday tweet indicates that the robotaxi is taking priority over the cheaper car, though both will be designed on the same platform. Reuters reported earlier Friday that the carmaker had called off plans for the less-expensive vehicle and was shifting more resources toward trying to bring a robotaxi to market. Musk responded by saying Reuters is lying, without offering specifics. Tesla also produced 46,561 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter, which has forced it to slash prices. US consumers have been turning away from more expensive EVs in favor of hybrid models, causing many manufacturers to rethink pushes to electrify their fleets. Splashy product announcements by Musk have always been a key part of Teslas ability to gin up enthusiasm among customers and investors without spending on traditional advertising. They dont always work: the company unveiled the Cybertruck to enormous fanfare in November 2019, but production was delayed for years and the ramp up of that vehicle has been slow. --With assistance from Catherine Larkin.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The rapid growth in sales comes at a time when EV growth in other key markets such as the United States and China are slowing. The report forecasts that by 2030, EVs are expected to represent nearly a third of India's personal vehicle market. CONTEXT India's EV market, small but growing, is dominated by domestic carmaker Tata Motors. Electric models made up 2% of total car sales in 2023 but the government is targeting 30% by 2030. The Indian government last month lowered EV import taxes on certain models if carmakers commit to invest at least $500 million and start domestic manufacturing within three years, a move seen as a win for foreign automakers including Tesla. Reuters reported on Thursday that Tesla has begun production of right-hand drive cars at its plant in Germany for export to India later this year. Vietnamese automaker VinFast also plans to invest $2 billion in the country and in February began constructing a factory in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. BY THE NUMBERS Tata Motors held more than two-thirds of the country's EV market last year, but lost ground to Mahindra & Mahindra and Chinese automaker BYD, according to the Counterpoint report. Mahindra & Mahindra recorded EV sales growth of nearly 2,500% last year with just one model, the all-electric SUV XUV400. BYD also made a big splash in the region last year, reporting over 1,500% in EV sales growth in the country with just two models in its India line-up, the e6 MPV and Atto 3 SUV.

A team from Tesla is expected to visit India later this month to look at sites for a local car manufacturing plant that would require an investment of about $2 billion, said two of the three people, who declined to be named because the plans are not public yet. India last month slashed the import tax rate on certain electric vehicles if their makers invest at least $500 million in the country and start production there within three years. The move is a win for Tesla, which had lobbied for months for lower taxes, but faced resistance from local carmakers. ""The right-hand drive cars which will be allocated to India, they have started building them,"" one of the people said, with some cars due to be shipped to India by the end of the year. It was not immediately clear which model Tesla plans to export to India. It currently produces only the Model Y at its factory near Berlin. Under the new Indian policy, companies can import up to 8,000 cars a year at the lower tax rate. Tesla did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside U.S. office hours. The plans for shipments to India are the first indication of right-hand drive (RHD) cars being produced in Berlin. Tesla's Shanghai plant, its primary export hub located nearer to right-hand-drive markets, such as Australia and Japan, has so far handled production of such vehicles. Tesla imported RHD Model Y vehicles for its launch in the UK from China and has not said whether it has shifted to importing from Berlin. The carmaker has eyed the Indian market for years and its officials visited the country several times over the past year. CEO Elon Musk also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York last June. Tesla's push into India comes at a time when slowing EV demand in its main U.S. and China markets coincides with intensifying competition from Chinese players. That caused Tesla to report a drop in its first-quarter deliveries and miss estimates. Tesla's India entry plan also includes investment in a charging network, which will come on top of the $2 billion earmarked for the plant, and sourcing more components locally, said one of the three sources. ""Tesla already imports parts from India and is now looking at reducing sourcing from China and making India a bigger sourcing hub,"" said the person. Tesla is looking at the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra in the west, and Modi's home state of Gujarat for its factory, which it expects to build in two years, two of the sources said. India's EV market, small but growing, is dominated by domestic carmaker Tata Motors. Electric models made up 2% of total car sales in 2023 but the government is targeting 30% by 2030. In January, Tesla's Vietnamese rival VinFast agreed to invest $2 billion in India and started building an EV factory in Tamil Nadu state.

Despite a slowdown in sales across the globe, the sale of EVs in India appears to be experiencing exponential growth. In the fiscal year (FY) 2024, the sales of electric passenger cars and SUVs reached 90,033 units, nearly doubling from the 47,544 units sold in the previous fiscal year. Tata Motors sold 70% or 63,545 of them in FY2024, driven by the popularity of models such as the Nexon EV, Tigor and Tiagos electric variants, and most recently, the Punch EV. Sales have doubled almost every year since the launch of the Nexon EV in 2020. In FY2021, it sold 4,218 units; in FY2022, 19,106 units; and in FY2023, 47,792 units. The last six years saw an unprecedented EV boom in the country  95% of all the EVs sold happened between FY 2019 and 2024. The Tatas happened to tap into the segment at the right time. Tata Motors has been making cars in India for decades, but it has found its place in the limelight only in the last few years thanks to the success it has seen in the EV segment. Maruti Suzuki still holds the coveted number-one spot in terms of sales, but it still does not have an EV. This is because the company is unsure about the increased interest in EVs converting to sales. It has also been waiting for costs to come down. Instead, Maruti has established itself as a hybrid leader, with six models launched already. It is betting heavily on the strong hybrid category with a Toyota 1.5-litre, three-cylinder powertrain being used in an upcoming variant of the Grand Vitara. To be sure, Marutis bet seems to be on point as interest in EVs is dipping and demand for hybrids is rising the world over, a Deloitte report showed. Tata Motors and Hyundai Motors India are locked for the number-two spot, with each one overtaking the other almost every few months. In part one we followed the unique journeys of the two automakers in the last two decades. Now the question is will EVs decide who wins the crown? EVs are estimated to make up 20-25% of the Indian car market by 2030. But there are still other alternative energy options. So you still have a vast market, which is either gas-based, CNG-based, gasoline-based or hybrid-based, Puneet Gupta, director of Indian Automotive Market at S&P Global Mobility, told The Core. One has only to look at the slowing China market, thanks to a drop in consumer spending and reduced government subsidies, to remain cautious about the EV bet. And yet, the industry outlook remains optimistic for India. What also cannot be ignored is Tata Motors meteoric rise to number two in the last decade, propelled in part by its EV bet in the last three years. All the market leaders in India, Gupta added, have their strategies and bets to hedge on. Everybody is putting its eggs in all the baskets trying to mitigate the risk. In FY2023-24, Hyundais Indian arm achieved record-breaking sales of 7,77,876 units marking an impressive 8% year-on-year growth. This includes both domestic sales, which hit a record-breaking 614,721 units, and exports as well. The driving force behind this was its best-selling compact SUV, the Creta, alongside other models like the Venue and the Exter, launched just the previous year. Hyundai Motor India introduced several new models and product upgrades in 2023, including the Exter, the new Creta, Creta N Line, new i20, and the introduction of ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) in Hyundai Venue and Venue N Line variants. Tata Motors, meanwhile, has been steadily narrowing the gap with Hyundai in recent years, achieving its highest-ever annual sales of passenger vehicles at 5,73,495 units. Tatas sales were driven by its SUVs and electric vehicles  bestsellers included the long-time favourite Nexon, and Tatas rival to the Exter, the micro SUV Punch. While Tata doesnt publish sales figures of individual EV models separately, 73,833 of its total sales volume was EVs in FY2024. Tata's rise in the ranks, from 6th place in 2015 to 3rd since 2020, is indicative of its growing influence in the Indian automotive market. Since 2021, Tata beat Hyundai for second place four times in monthly sales, including in February 2024. In March 2024, Hyundai's domestic sales rose by 5% to 53,001 units. Tata Motors recorded sales of 50,297 units in March 2024, up 14% from 44,225 units in March 2023.  This wasnt always the case. In part one, we wrote about how the two auto giants took very different paths to establish themselves in the Indian market. Tata Motors trudged along in the last two decades, learning harsh lessons from failures (like the Nano), and how a leadership shakeup ultimately led to the company reinventing itself. Meanwhile, Hyundai stayed steadfast, focusing on improving quality and design, all throughout. And now, here we are, with both companies neck to neck, and following distinct strategies. As Tata Motors announced the demerger of its commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses, Hyundai is reportedly planning to list its Indian arm  Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) for an initial public offering worth $3 billion this year. Reports have also surfaced that its EV subsidiary, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, is gearing up for an IPO in the financial year 2025-26. As market sentiments in the auto industry shift, Tata Motors intends to maintain its focus on EVs, leveraging its expertise in this segment. Meanwhile, Hyundai is poised to ramp up efforts to penetrate the EV market while also strengthening its SUV segment, which remains a top choice among Indian car buyers.  In FY2024, EVs in the passenger vehicle segment registered a growth of 89% year-on-year  according to Vahan data as of March 31. The models and companies making them have also grown. According to data compiled by auto research firm Jato Dynamics, the number of mass-market models has increased three times in 2023. It has grown from just four models by three manufacturers before the pandemic to 12 by seven companies last year. While Tata Motors was busy grabbing the largest chunk of the EV pie, its rivals have been reticent. Maruti Suzuki, the largest car maker in India, will launch its first EV only next year. Hyundai, which has firmly held on to the second spot (despite a tight race with Tata now) plans to charge in this year. Despite launching the Kona Electric in 2019, Hyundai holds only a 2% market share in India's EV space. Priced higher than competitors like the Nexon EV (the Kona starts at Rs. 23.84 lakh, as opposed to the Nexon EV at Rs 14.49 lakh) and hindered by limited charging infrastructure, the Kona Electric struggled to make a significant impact in the market. In FY2024, Hyundai sold 1,822 EV units, mainly driven by its premium offering  the Ioniq 5, launched last year. The company has plans to launch a line of new EVs in the next year or two, including an electric variant of its bestseller, the Creta and an Exter EV variant. It is a wise move as the push from the Indian government and improving charging infrastructure is driving adoption. New entrants as well as established players are increasingly looking to expand their EV offerings, given the governments apparent green push. The now-expired FAME-II scheme subsidised the costs of commercial cars and also pushed for building charging infrastructure. It is expected to be extended in the budget but as of now, the extension (with a Rs 500 crore outlay) is only for two and three-wheelers Plus, last month the government announced lowering import duties on EVs to 15% for premium vehicles (with terms that would push for more domestic manufacturing), which might pave the way for more global players (like Tesla) to enter the Indian market. Mahindra & Mahindra is planning to roll out five new EVs in the coming years. Maruti Suzuki, which has been relatively slow to get to EVs, might release its first model  the eVX, by the end of this year or 2025, and aims to have six models in the next seven to eight years. Tata has been quick to tap into this rising segment, while Hyundai is all set to dive in this year.    After the subcompact SUV Nexon, initially meant to be a bridge offering, became a hit thanks to its design, features and competitive pricing, Tata launched the Nexon EV in 2020. It came at a time when the appeal of SUVs was growing. It came with a choice of two engines, diesel and petrolthe same formula that had worked with Indica in 98, was applied in a more growing segment and it was made very aspirational, Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India, told The Core. Like its ICE variant, the Nexon EV was a hit and is still the highest-selling EV in India, crossing 50,000 unit sales in June last year. The cars safety features, connected car technology, and design, as well as its affordability as a long-range car, propelled it to the top. Soon after, Tata launched the Tigor and Tiago EV variants. While the Nexon was pitched as a personal car, making EVs aspirational, the company entered the fleet market with Tigor, taking advantage of the FAME-II subsidy, which drove volumes. The first phase of its electrification journey was low-investment and low-risk, Tata Motors chairman Shailesh Chandra had said in an interview in 2022. It involved converting existing ICE variants to electric. What helped, along with this strategy, was that they were the first in the market with proper high-voltage architecture. The Tata Group announced in 2020 that six companies from the group (Tata Motors, Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Croma, Tata Auto Components, and Tata Motors) are coming together to create an ecosystem for EVs, including manufacturing batteries, and components and creating charging facilities. I think it was a big bet and I think that credit has to go to N Chandrasekaran (then-chairman of Tata Motors), Sorabjee said. It also pushed to build its own supply chain and reduce dependence on imports that could be affected by global disruptions. In June last year, the Tata Group invested Rs 13,000 crore to set up a lithium-ion cell factory in Gujarats Sanand, which is expected to be operational in three years. The company also aims to increase the localisation of its EVs to 85% by 2025, it said in an investor presentation in 2023 and mentioned plans to tie up with over 20 high-voltage component suppliers in the next three to four years. It was reported last year that auto components major Tata AutoComp had lined up at least half of an investment of around Rs 2,500 crore for localising EV components. Interestingly, this EV universe that Tata is creating, rings similar to the South Korean chaebol (industrial conglomerate controlled by a family) which Hyundai harnessed to support its business in India. India's charging infrastructure, a significant obstacle to widespread adoption, is being tackled head-on by the group's power arm. Leading the charge is Tata Power, which has emerged as the market leader in charging infrastructure. As of September 2023, they boasted an impressive network of 61,959 home charging points and 4,932 public charging stations. I think first, [they] played safe, now they know that EV is something which can really put them on the fast path relative to the competitors, Gupta said. They got their dealer network all charged up, he said. Last year in September Tata Motors announced a separate sales network for EVs. Company CEO Shailesh Chandra told reporters that the company would start with exclusive EV stores in pilot cities where demand was high. Another thing Tata Motors got right this time was identifying segments, an auto columnist who preferred anonymity pointed out. With the Tata Punch, launched in 2021, the company entered the micro-SUV segment and has managed to dominate it despite promising competition. By January 2024, the model had sold 3 lakh units. Starting with Nexon, Tata started putting more emphasis on safety in its marketing. The Nexon has received a five-star rating from the global NCAP in child occupant safety as well as adult occupant safety. The flagship Tata Safari and the Tata Harrier both scored a five-star safety rating at both Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. These ratings indicate how safe a car is, in accidents, and are determined by aspects like frontal crash protection, side crash protection, rollover safety and seat belt use. With its focus on EVs, Tata Motors also managed to shed its image of a truck maker that was stitching together cars. Now, its synonymous with EVs, which in turn are currently synonymous with the future of mobility. There are still glitches of course. Complaints of Tata Motors EVs facing battery issues, as well as problems with after-sales services flood social media and community forums on the daily. But it seems the companys current focus is to keep boosting production. Tata Motors plans to start production at its Sanand plant, acquired from Ford last year, this month with the Nexon EV. The plant has an installed capacity of 3 lakh units per annum, which can be scaled up to 4.2 lakh units per annum. New launches, including the Curvv EV and the Harrier EV, are also on the cards. The Core has reached out to Tata Motors and Hyundai Motors and will update this story when they respond. Hyundai, meanwhile, has been heavily betting on its SUV offerings, especially the Creta, for volume sales. In March this year, the Creta sold a record 16,458 units, the highest since it was launched in 2015, and topping its record of 15,276 units in February 2024. The company got 60% of its overall sales from SUVs in FY2023 and expects it to increase to 65% in FY2024. It plans to start production at Maharashtras Talegaon plant, which it acquired from General Motors India earlier this year, by 2025. The plant has an existing annual production capacity of 1,30,000 units and would help the carmaker achieve its goal of producing 10,00,00 units annually. While it plans to raise its EV game, the focus wont be on volumes, the companys COO Tarun Garg said in a recent interview. Hyundais premium offering Ioniq 5 (priced Rs 46 lakh ex-showroom), launched in January last year, is leading the EV sales. And it had only crossed 1,000 unit sales in November 2023. True to its nature, the company tested the Indian market with the Kona in 2019 to understand the needs. But there are fears that it may have been too late. The big step has been taken, we have tested the market, we are feeling much more confident. The EV market in India has moved much faster and there are other people who have already taken a lead, we have to catch up,"" Garg said in another interview. Right now, Hyundais focus is very much on introducing new models. One of the key things the company has started working on is localising EV components. In a 2020 interview, SS Kim, the managing director of Hyundai Motor India said that the company was exploring partnerships with local suppliers to increase localisation. It was also in talks with global battery suppliers, including LG Chem, to discuss collaboration for battery cell procurement for the local market, Kim had said. Similar to its strategy for conventional fuel vehicles, the company aims to achieve over 90% localisation once it introduces affordable mass-market EVs, planned for launch next year. It has already started work on a plant to localise battery pack assembly in Chennai  which will commence operations in 2025 and have an annual capacity of 75,000 battery packs. Hyundai is expected to pour more money into its EV operations following the IPO and go for a strategy where they earn money from India and reinvest in India. Given the acceleration, I would say Hyundai has a better place to take that second spot, Sorabjee said. While Tata Motors has been able to establish itself as a market leader in electric vehicles in India, Hyundai Motors India is likely to catch up soon.",
"Every car should have only one FASTag: One vehicle, One Fastag","NHAI's 'One Vehicle, One FASTag' rule aims to curb misuse, but users can easily manage their accounts. Checking FASTag status involves visiting the official website, inputting vehicle details, and reviewing the status. To update KYC, users can access NHAI or bank portals and follow simple steps. This ensures compliance and smooth FASTag usage.",https://trak.in/stories/every-car-should-have-only-one-fastag-one-vehicle-one-fastag-policy-imposed/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh Apr 03, 2024 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) recently implemented the One Vehicle, One FASTag policy, effective from April 1. This directive prohibits the use of a single FASTag across multiple vehicles or associating multiple FASTags with one vehicle.  The decision aims to address concerns over the misuse of FASTags, such as instances of vehicles equipped with multiple FASTags or FASTags issued without proper adherence to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. NHAIs Move and Rationale Behind It: NHAIs decision to enforce the One Vehicle, One FASTag rule stemmed from reports indicating various forms of misuse of FASTags. Vehicles were observed with multiple FASTags, leading to discrepancies, or FASTags were issued without completing the mandatory KYC process. Such practices not only violated regulatory guidelines but also resulted in inefficiencies at toll plazas, causing delays and inconvenience to other highway users. Consequently, NHAI introduced this policy to streamline FASTag usage and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Fastag Recharge and Flexibility: Under the One Vehicle, One FASTag principle, each vehicle should be associated with a single active FASTag. If a vehicle has multiple FASTags, only the most recently acquired one remains active, while the others are deactivated. However, vehicle owners retain the flexibility to recharge their FASTags through any bank or via various payment methods, including BBPS, UPI, and net banking. This approach offers convenience and ease of management for FASTag accounts. Step-by-Step Process for Checking FASTag Status: Users can easily verify the status of FASTags linked to their vehicles by following these simple steps. This process ensures transparency and enables users to stay informed about their FASTag accounts status. Updating FASTag KYC: To maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and ensure seamless FASTag usage, it is essential to keep the KYC details updated. Heres how users can update their FASTag KYC: For NHAI FASTags: For Bank-Issued FASTags: Completing the KYC process ensures that users FASTag accounts remain compliant with regulatory standards. Users receive notifications via email, SMS, or the banks app if their KYC is incomplete.

Tata vs Hyundai: two giants shaping India's auto scene,"Explore the journey of Tata Motors and Hyundai in India, two automotive giants that have significantly contributed to the industry's growth. From humble beginnings to market leadership, their belief in the India story has driven innovation and expansion, making them key players in the country's automotive sector.",https://www.thecore.in/business/tata-motors-hyundai-india-auto-giants-believed-india-story-4443387?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"While Hyundai has held the number 2 position in the Indian auto sector for over two decades, Tata Motors catapulted to it by completely reinventing itself. This is part one of a two-part series on the growth of Tata Motors and Hyundai Motor India. In August 1998, a new series of advertisements hit Indian TV screens. They showed a mysterious Asian man, ?Mr Kim?, trying to convince actor Shah Rukh Khan to advertise his company?s new car in India. ?Why me?? asks Khan in the first part of the four-part ad series. Mr Kim replies, ?Because Hyundai settles on nothing but the best.? By the fourth part Khan, then on a path to becoming a superstar, is on board, won over by Kim's persistence, the company?s technology and its dedication to the Indian market. Cut to September 1998, the South Korean automaker launched the Santro ? its first ?made in India? car, an entry-level hatchback with a unique design, manufactured at its plant in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. Two years later, the Santro was zipping through sales, averaging 1 lakh sales every year for the next decade. During the same time, a legacy company known for its trucks, launched its first fully indigenous passenger car, the Tata Indica. The car made a big splash and received over 1 lakh bookings in the first few weeks. Back then, both Tata Motors and Hyundai Motor India saw Maruti Suzuki, and its hatchback bestseller Zen, as their main competitor.

By the fourth part Khan, then on a path to becoming a superstar, is on board, won over by Kim's persistence, the companys technology and its dedication to the Indian market. Cut to September 1998, the South Korean automaker launched the Santro  its first made in India car, an entry-level hatchback with a unique design, manufactured at its plant in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. Two years later, the Santro was zipping through sales, averaging 1 lakh sales every year for the next decade. During the same time, a legacy company known for its trucks, launched its first fully indigenous passenger car, the Tata Indica. The car made a big splash and received over 1 lakh bookings in the first few weeks. Back then, both Tata Motors and Hyundai Motor India saw Maruti Suzuki, and its hatchback bestseller Zen, as their main competitor. While both the Santro and Indica were popular cars, Hyundai quickly rose in the ranks to clinch second place in the Indian car market. Twenty-five years on, Indias car market has changed significantly in its preferences. One thing that hasnt changed is that Maruti Suzuki is still the number one car manufacturer in the country, in terms of sales volume. But Hyundai (which held on firmly to the number two position for over two decades) and Tata Motors are now caught in a tight race for the second spot before they go for the behemoth. Each month is a new challenge between the two automakers. In February, Tata Motors, which has seen its fair share of slumps and rebounds, beat Hyundai in domestic vehicle sales by a sliver. However, Hyundai not only took over as number two in March sales again but also posted its best-ever annual domestic sales at 6,14,721 units. Tata Motors, meanwhile, also posted its highest-ever annual sales at 5,73,495 units. Plus, the company is on its way to setting up a new manufacturing facility worth Rs 9,000 crore in Ranipet, Tamil Nadu. Quite literally on the heels of Hyundai. So what happens now? This tale is of two giants steadfast in their belief in the 'India story'. One with a legacy spanning more than a century, who knew the Indian market, but took a while to figure out cars. The other, a South Korean upstart, that had entered the US market barely a decade before its ambitious plans to enter the nascent Indian market and capitalise on it. Earlier this month, Tata Motors announced the demerger of its commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses. The company called this a logical progression since the businesses have had separate CEOs since 2021 and were subsidiarised in 2022. Tatas PV business includes traditional passenger cars, electric vehicles (EVs), and luxury cars under the Jaguar-Land Rover division, with the company heavily betting on its EV segment. Four years since Tata launched its first EV for private use, it has managed to snag almost three-quarters of the EV market share in India. The demerger underlines Tatas confidence in its ability to expand in the PV segment. The Tatas have now become the pioneers of Indias transition to EVs. Word is that the companys EV subsidiary, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, is gearing up for an IPO in the financial year 2025-26. As a senior auto columnist, who wished to remain anonymous, put it  Tata Motors is definitely winning the perception war regardless of other considerations. In the last decade, it has managed to shed its image as just a truck company and is now being associated with EVs  widely seen as the future of automotive technology. Where is Hyundai, you ask? Not far behind. The South Korean giant is planning to list its Indian unit for an initial public offering worth $3 billion this year, making it the largest in India. It is reportedly planning to file draft IPO papers by May-June for approval, and the issue may be launched by October-November. The fundraising would put its Indian units valuation at more than half its market capitalisation of $47 billion in Seoul, according to a Reuters report. The company will likely scale up its EV operations after the IPO. Hyundai Motor Indias COO Tarun Garg said earlier this year that battery electric vehicles were the ultimate destination for the Indian auto industry, adding that while its hybrids were doing well in the US and Europe, they dont make sense here given the current tax structure. They (Hyundai) wouldnt like to bring their money from Korea at this stage. So they would like to basically earn money from India and reinvest in India, Puneet Gupta, director of Indian Automotive Market at S&P Global Mobility, told The Core.  The Santro, which in hindsight can be called a raging success, wasnt well-liked by everyone at first sight. When we saw the Hyundai Atos (rebranded as Santro), our hearts sank, recalled Subhabhrata Ghosh, who was then-executive director of Saatchi & Saatchi, the agency tasked with launching the Santro in India. It was exactly the opposite of the car that was in vogue those days, which was a small sleek hatchback called the Maruti Zen, Ghosh said. The Santro came with a tall boy design, originally a Japanese concept (Maruti Suzuki came out with the original tall boy, the WagonR, a year later). This was widely mocked by the Indian audience it was tested on. Modifications were made to soften and round the back of the car. Still, the challenge was getting the audience to change their perception. The Core reached out to Hyundai Motor India and Tata Motors and will update the story when they respond. The car is now almost synonymous with Hyundai for a generation of Indians, exactly the way the car maker wanted it to be. Hyundai was very clear and we were very clear that communication has to play a major role in building the story and the image of Hyundai and the image of Hyundai would be built around the image of Santro, Ghosh said. Thats where Shah Rukh Khan came in. Who better to sell the car to lakhs of India than the superstar, who at the time was at the peak of his career? Ghosh credits the decision to get him on board to BVR Subbu, an auto industry stalwart and then-president of Hyundai Motor India. The pre-launched advertisement portrayed Khan as almost a proxy for an Indian customer planning to buy a car. He was made to ask the right questions  from how to pronounce the companys name to what kind of features it was offering, and what set it apart. Amit Mukherjee, then-associate creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi, who also worked on the campaign, said. On a scale of 1-10 on what helped launch the Santro, I think I would give the ad campaign and Shah Rukh being the ambassador an 8. While the launch helped build curiosity and also familiarity, what established Santro were the features and quality that it offered. It was, in many ways, Indias first feature-rich car. Instead of a carburettor, it offered a multi-port fuel injection engine with three valves in the entry-level segment for the first time. It always positioned itself as more premium than Maruti Suzuki, Gupta said. Santro didnt take off immediately. It took some time and convincing to convert bookings into actual deliveries and sales, Manish Nair, then-sales manager for Hyundai Motor India in Rajasthan, and now market CEO of Mercedes-Benz India toldThe Core. Compare this to the Indica, which was launched a few months later, and opened to over 1 lakh bookings. But for the Indica, those couldnt all be converted into sales and deliveries. Not only did Hyundai use the charm of King Khan, they focused their energies on building relationships with their customers and getting solid feedback from them. Early car buyers were asked for feedback and used as references or local brand ambassadors. BVR Subbu built a network of dealers who had no prior experience selling cars. Many of them came from two-wheeler dealerships they had the hunger to establish this car and get sales, Nair said. The team also focused on penetrating the market beyond the urban areas as well, something that Maruti had already established. But what really built the brand was that the Koreans had a very smart refresh and relaunch programme, said Ghosh. Within a year of launching, the Santro received its first update called the Zipdrive, with a first-in-segment power steering, a new radiator grille and a sporty rear spoiler. The Santro Zip Plus was soon introduced, and then the Santro Xing by 2003. By then, Santro was a darling, Ghosh said. When Hyundai entered India, it wasnt the only one trying to cash in on the countrys promising auto market. However, most others played it safe and entered the market with joint ventures. They also started with launch-pad models to assess the market. There was General Motors with the Opel Astra, South Korean competitor Daewoo with the Cielo, and Ford entering into a JV with Mahindra. None of these automakers have stuck around. Ford exited the country in 2021, GM in 2017 and Daewoo was gone by 2003. How did Hyundai manage to stay put? It always had a first mover advantage, Gupta explained. Santro established a strong foundation for the company, and it didnt waste any time building on it. In 1999, it launched the Hyundai Accent, for Indias still nascent sedan market, and soon after, the Sonata, for a more premium sedan segment. The Accent was priced starting at Rs 5.35 lakh, giving it an edge over competitors in the mid-size sedan segment. Hyundai officials even claimed that it would have the technology and luxury of a Mitsubishi Lancer, then priced at a base model level of Rs 7.80 lakh. The Accents main competitor was Marutis Esteem, priced slightly lower at Rs 4.76 lakh. Accent overtook in only four months after launching, clocking over 2,500 sales a month. The Sonata was priced between Rs 11-13 lakh. The car model, with a 2 litre petrol engine, was cheaper than the manual transmission variant of the Honda Accord, its main competition priced at Rs 14.95 lakh. Other competitors were the Ford Mondeo (priced at around Rs 16 lakh) and the Mercedes C Class (Rs 23 lakh). By 2002, Hyundai crossed the 1 lakh sales mark, taking the number 2 spot and holding on to it for years to come. The company was adept at not just identifying segments, but creating new categories in the market. It did this with the Santro first, and later with the i20 and the Creta SUV. Yet, Hyundai has only been at number two, never being able to take over the number 1 spot. ""Hyundai appears to be content to be No 2. It was different when we started when the entire focus was to become No 1,"" BVR Subbu was quoted as saying in an article in The Economic Times in 2012. This was when the company had registered its biggest fall in sales  by 14% to less than 31,000 units. By 2012, Hyundai had launched a slew of cars. Its strategy was simple and offered one or two cars in each customer segment. To maintain its lead and also take on the competition, Hyundai followed two critical strategies  localising processes, and using India as an export hub. Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) had become a small car export hub for the larger global corporation by 2003. This strategy has continued. It exported almost 40-50% of its production from India, which helped it make products at competitive prices for the domestic market. Until about five years ago, Hyundai was a pretty aggressive exporter from India in the last five years, the India market has been really booming. So they had to push more domestically and reduce their exports, Gupta said. Hyundai was quick to localise its processes. For one, it created strong supplier ecosystems near its plant in Sriperumbudur, in regions such as Kanchipuram and Thiruvalluvar. The company helped suppliers gain access to international manufacturing technology and standards, which allowed them to achieve more localisation. Hyundai Mobis, the companys auto parts partner, also launched operations in India in 2007, further reducing dependence on imports. Not just that, Hyundai also focused on localising talent. While its main R&D was in Namyang, South Korea, it developed the Hyundai Motor India Engineering (HMIE), launched in 2009, to become a major R&D unit to service the Indian market. Hyundais small car offering  Eon, which had a global launch in India in 2011, was designed in Namyang, but engineers from Hyderabad made several suggestions, including a bi-fuel engine. Sravan Kumar, an engineer who worked at Hyundais Hyderabad R&D centre for nine years, told The Core that Indian engineers were sent to South Korea frequently for training and eventually their dependence on Korean expertise reduced. Having established itself for its uncompromising quality, Hyundai shifted its attention to aesthetics. In 2010, the company introduced a new design philosophy called the fluidic sculpture design philosophy. In India, it was first introduced on its premier sedan, the Verna, and the Eon, in 2011 and then used for the i20, the grand i10 and the Elantra as well. This was part of a global strategy to give the company an edge over its competitors, as well as bring some uniformity to Hyundais cars, all of which had been designed individually before this. It also helped Hyundai position itself in a more premium market segment, against competitors such as Volkswagen and BMW. Considered to be a bold move when it was introduced, the company wanted the design rejig to give its cars a modern premium vibe, as Hyundai Designer Casey Hyun put it in a 2014 interview. Hyundai has, over the last twenty years, managed to stay at number two. However, its market share has reduced over time. While it grew from about 14% in 2009 to 17.4% in 2021, it is now back to 14.89% in FY2023, amid new competition and slackening demand for hatchbacks. India has always been a priority market for Hyundai though. Immediately after launching, Hyundai posted a profit after its first full year of operations, at Rs 59.3 crore after tax in 2000. It has been profitable every year since, except for in financial year 2008-9, when it posted its first annual loss. In 2023, India accounted for 18.6% of Hyundais global sales in terms of volume and is number three after the US and South Korean markets. HMIL also posted its highest-ever revenues and profits in FY2023, with the turnover crossing Rs 60,000 crore and profits growing 62% to Rs 4,653, the highest among the non-listed automotive companies in the country. Last year, HMILs CEO and MD, Unsoo Kim told the media that the company expects to make up more than 20% of Hyundais global sales volumes in the next two-three years. In comparison to Santro and its maker, the trajectory of Indica and Tata Motors was a bit different. On its launch in 1998, it was received really well. It came with a diesel engine, making it a cheaper option to buy and run. But it soon ran into issues with reliability  from engineering issues like tailpipes falling off, troubles with winding the windows, and overheating, to abysmal after-sales service. A second version was launched to address the reliability and refinement issues. That too failed. The problems being faced were very different from its truck businessserviceability was a big area of concern, a former business unit head and assistant general manager at Tata Motors, who worked there for 19 years, and requested anonymity, said. In terms of competition, the company itself could be called its competition when issues cropped up in the car, the ex-Tata Motors employee said. He added that the company took a while to figure out its hubris and the faults in its engineering process. The company developed the 207 platform (design architectures that make up the underfloor, engine compartment and frame of the car), which was used for the Tata Sierra, Estate, Sumo and Safari, from the ground up. It was inspired by contemporaries like Toyota Hilux and Nissan A new engine was developed in-house inspired by the 207s 483 DL engine, which was then downsized for the Indica. The 207 platform had a lot of issues, but it took them a great amount of time to actually accept and rectify them, he added. Tata's aspiration was to provide a world-class product. But somewhere considering the needs of the markets, it went into multiple categories and lost control, Gupta said. It had big ambitions for the Nano, launched in 2008, which it had termed as the peoples car. Tata was making the cheapest car  it cost Rs 1 lakh, barely more than a two-wheeler but it ran into trouble from the get-go. For one, the earliest versions of the car brought up several safety concerns. There were reports of cars catching fire, attributed to various factors, including faulty electrical systems and fuel leakage. Plus, the basic model of the Tata Nano lacked certain safety features like airbags and antilock braking systems (ABS). The car being marketed as the cheapest car in the world also worked against it. Despite the company pushing for years, the Nano couldnt shake off this negative publicity. Months before the car was launched, analysts projected that the carmaker would report a net earnings decline of around 30% for three months, due to rising costs. It had just acquired the Jaguar and Land Rover businesses from Ford for $2.3 billion, and its stock was down 42%. To bring down the cost of manufacturing the car, as well as in dire need of outside innovation, Tata Motors had pushed suppliers and vendors to bring down, not only the cost, but also the weight of the components. Most of the vendors stuck to the rigid cost and engineering guidelines, and delivered, knowing they would not start making profits for the first few years. What came out was a revolutionary product in the way it was designed to be frugal. For instance, Sona Koyo and Rane Group came up with hollow steering shafts, saving cost and reducing weight. Rico Auto, which supplied the engine block, used aluminium to reduce weight. Bosch, which developed the braking system, configured it so that the conventional vacuum booster wasnt needed, to keep costs low. The cars seats and window winding mechanism were inspired by helicopter seats and windows. And yet, there were more challenges. For one, it faced challenges in setting up its factory in Singur, West Bengal from Mamata Banerjees TMC, which at the time was the states main opposition. Getting suppliers from auto centres in Pune, Chennai and Delhi, to Singur was already difficult. At one point, suppliers halted investments due to political uncertainty. The company then shifted production to Sanand, Gujarat. By 2013, component suppliers were asking the company for a price rise. Tata also launched the Manza, a compact sedan and Vista, a successor to Indica Vista, in 2009, in a bid to refresh its lineup. Both failed miserably and were discontinued in 2014. After sustained efforts to increase sales, Tata also discontinued the Nano in 2018. It wasnt like Tata-made cars were not seen on Indian roads. The Indica, Tata Sumo and Indigo were popular cars, but they failed to convert into numbers. In 2009, Tata had dipped below Mahindra and Mahindra to become the fourth largest car maker in the country. And between 2010 and 2016, its market share fell from 13.7% to 4.6%. New generation versions of its old classics like Tata Safari and Sumo, didnt find many takers in the passenger vehicle market and were relegated to the sidelines, adopted mainly by taxi fleet drivers. But they persevered they kept learning and experimenting and pushing, the employee said. The company, however, maintained its profitability during this time. In FY2009, Tata Motors' standalone Indian operations' profits declined by 51% over the previous year, thanks to a global economic downturn and JLR sales declining. It still posted a net profit of Rs 1,001 crore. It bounced back somewhat and managed to maintain profitability in the next year, with a net profit of Rs.2,571 crore. Its financial performance jumped over three-fold to Rs 9,274 crore in 2010-11, thanks to global economic recovery as well as a pick up in JLRs sales in key markets. Profits in FY2012 also rose to Rs 13,516 crore thanks to increased sales of PVs and CVs, as well as better JLR sales. Net profits dipped in FY2013, to Rs 9,893 crore, amid a slowdown in the Indian automotive industry. They improved marginally in FY2014 to Rs 13,991 crore and remained flat in FY2015, thanks to a slowdown in demand, and increased competition.  Tatas acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover as its wholly-owned subsidiary in 2008 helped it get insights into the global market (something Hyundai had had an edge over before this). It got access to JLRs advanced auto technologies, expertise in luxury vehicle manufacturing, and R&D capabilities which helped the company enhance its product offerings. Tata also gained access to JLR's design studios in the UK, including the Jaguar Design Studio in Coventry and the Land Rover Design Studio in Gaydon. It also briefly collaborated with Italian car design firm Pininfarina, to develop concept cars and trucks. But this was not what turned the tide. A spree of new hirings breathed new life into a company that was struggling to stay relevant. It started with Karl Slym, who came on board as Tata Motors managing director in 2012, until he died due to suicide in 2014. He really set a lot of things in motion, Hormazd Sorabjee, editor at Autocar India, told The Core. After Slym, ex-airbus COO from Germany, Guenter Butschek, came on as Tata Motors CEO in 2016. Butschek, who was part of the company till 2021, propelled the company forward. Under him, Tata Motors checked its expenses through cost cutting and got rid of unnecessary platforms. There was greater integration with JLR and the company hired several top former executives from Maruti. The Nano debacle also taught the Tatas a thing or two. While it was advertising and constant innovation for Hyundai, the engineering and ecosystem-building lessons Tatas learnt while making the Nano helped play a key role too. Leveraging synergies within the Tata Group to build cars was another game changer. After 2016, an unlikely winner emerged. At the time, Tata was working on two new platforms  the Alfa and Omega platforms (on which the Harrier, 2019 and Altroz, 2020) were launched. While it was working on these, it needed bridge products to draw customers in. These were the Nexon, Tigor and Tiago. This time Tata Motors also decided to onboard a celebrity  football legend Lionel Messi  to endorse its cars, to perhaps make up for what Hyundai had gained all those years ago with Khan. The Nexon became a game-changer for Tata Motors. Not only was it feature-rich but also because of its design. It had dual front airbags for the base variants, multiple drive modes, and an 8-speaker, 6.5-inch touchscreen Harman infotainment system. By 2018, the model contributed to as much as 50% of the companys utility vehicle sales. In that fiscal year, the company sold 51,891 utility vehicles, of which 27,747 were the Nexon. In 2019, it launched the Nexon EV, which propelled the company to dominate a sizable chunk of the EV market, coming at a time when the EV segment was ripe for the taking. In February, Tata Motors sold 51,321 units domestically, registering a 19% year-on-year rise. Close behind, Hyundai sold 50,201 units in the month, with the volume up by 7% year-on-year. Hyundais India arm registered its highest-ever revenue in FY 2022-23 at Rs 60,000 crore and clocked profits of Rs 4,653 crore. Tata Motors passenger vehicle arm posted Rs 47,868 crore in revenue in FY 2022-23. This does not include the significant numbers that JLR brings in. After the demerger, where JLR will be a part of its PV business, its revenue is expected to be around Rs 2,75,000 crore, 2.4 times that of market leader Maruti Suzuki (Rs 1,17,571 crore). The demerger will take about 15 months to be implemented. But lets not forget Hyundais $3 billion IPO. Both companies are also poised to introduce a slew of new variants and models in the market, making the competition for number 2 even more fierce. Read part 2 here. While Hyundai has held the number 2 position in the Indian auto sector for over two decades, Tata Motors catapulted to it by completely reinventing itself.",

Please wait Home > Sectors > Electronics New PLI Scheme For Component Makers To Replace SPECS After Polls New Delhi, Apr 1 (KNN) The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) will unveil a new production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for electronic component manufacturing after the general elections. This move comes as the current Rs 3,285 crore Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) expired on March 31, 2024. While no new applications will be accepted under SPECS, the government will continue disbursing incentives to the 42 companies already selected with proposed investments totalling Rs 11,690 crore. As of February 2024, Rs 378.37 crore in incentives had been disbursed. The upcoming PLI scheme will work like others by offering incentives based on achieving incremental production and sales targets. Officials are identifying the list of eligible components. Discussions with industry are underway to design the new scheme with a focus on increasing domestic value addition as electronics exports rise. Issues with SPECS included a ""one size fits all"" approach bundling all components together despite differing financial needs. ""We are looking to design products in India, own the IP, and increase the number of components manufactured domestically,"" said MeitY Secretary S. Krishnan. India aims to become an electronics manufacturing hub with USD 300 billion in production targeted by 2025-26, up fr0m USD 102 billion in FY23. Leading executives have been tapped to develop a component manufacturing roadmap. The new PLI scheme is part of efforts to make India both a product nation and component-producing destination after success in becoming a mobile phone exporter.

Each month, automobile makers in India release wholesale numbers, or vehicle sales to dealers. Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Hero MotoCorp will report monthly numbers later in the day. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The numbers are seen as a key indicator of private consumption in India. The auto sector carries more than 50% weightage in calculating the country's economic growth. CONTEXT A surge in domestic sales of pricier sport utility vehicles (SUVs) last year has extended into 2024. Utility vehicles accounted for nearly 60% of total passenger vehicle sales from April 2023 to February 2024, according to industry data. Entry-level car sales floundered last year. In a bid to increase demand, automakers have banked on higher discounts in the segment. Meanwhile, product launches and improved rural demand for entry-level models have helped bolster two-wheeler sales amid heated competition in the high-end segment.

Joey Gase was far from pleased about being turned around and sent into the wall by Dawson Cram at the Richmond Raceway.     It was lap 173 of the 250-lapNASCARXfinity Series race when Dawson Cram placed himself on the inside of Joey Gase entering Turn 1, which led to his No. 35 Chevrolet Camaro slamming hard into the nearby wall. The rear bumper of Joey Gases car was nearly ripped off due to a nasty collision, and the caution was out for the race.     Joey Gase managed to get out of his car before ripping off the rear bumper of the car. When he saw Dawson Cram coming towards his side of the track, he walked towards the inside lane before dumping the rear bumper over the No. 4 Chevrolet Camaro, in what could be considered a way of showcasing his outrage over the incident.     The first reaction from Joey Gase about getting sent into the wall by Dawson Cram was fiery, to say the least. He was quoted as saying to FS1, I think him just not having his head screwed on right.     You know I gave the kid his first opportunity ever in Xfinity and I know [team owner] Johnny Davis is in the business of wrecking race cars and we're definitely not we're a small team and racing hard for the lucky dog and apparently he just didn't know how to lift.

Halim, who was part of PluginIndia  Indias first community of EV users  is very clued in on developments in the EV space and experiments by other EV users. He also installed an active cell balancer, which reduces the chance of one individual cell degrading quicker than others, in the car. It has been around two years since Halim got his battery pack repaired. His car has had a range of about 90 km per charge. While this is not a permanent solution, it has significantly increased the life of his battery. Like Halim, several early adopters of electric two-wheelers, whose vehicles were past the warranty period, preferred to have their battery packs repaired rather than replaced. Alan, who runs an electric scooter service centre in Ernakulam, Kerala toldThe Core that his centre gets five to ten vehicles a month for battery repairs. Most of these, he said, come from scooters that have been in the market for longer than five years, like Okinawa, Benling, Kinetic Green and more. While users of vehicles aged five to ten years have the option of repairing their batteries, this may not be the case for those buying EVs today. Newer EV batteries are increasingly difficult to repair, with some being completely sealed. Third-party mechanics also dont have access to design or diagnostic data from manufacturers. This will not only increase costs for users but also contradict the fundamental purpose of EVs being sustainable. An electric vehicle, unlike an internal combustion engine vehicle, runs on a battery that doesnt last forever. With each charge and discharge cycle, the battery degrades a little. On average, the EV battery degrades about 1-2% each year, depending on usage patterns and charging habits. As the battery degrades, the vehicles range drops, eventually leading to the need for repair or replacement. Apart from general degradation and range issues, EV users sometimes need to fix faulty parts, like the battery management system (BMS). Currently, a battery pack makes up about half (or more) of the cost of an EV, making the prospect of replacing it a major anxiety for users. To alleviate this anxiety, several manufacturers in India offer extended warranties specifically for batteries. While Ather Energy offers an extended battery warranty of five years, Ola Electric announced an eight-year extended warranty in February. Tata Motors offers an eight-year or 1,60,000km (whichever is earlier) warranty on the battery and motor of its vehicles. At the moment, if a battery under warranty malfunctions, the company replaces the battery. Because of the extended warranty, and cost-free replacement, newer EV users are often opting to get their batteries replaced instead of repaired. Lithium-ion battery prices have been dropping faster than expected. According to Goldman Sachs, battery prices might fall by 40% by 2025, thanks to dropping prices of raw materials. It is still early days, and the technology is rapidly evolving. New vehicles have more sophisticated, better-quality battery packs, designed to last longer. So while there isnt a definitive answer to how long your battery will last, various studies peg it anywhere between 8-20 years. Early adopters were also luckier with repairs. Batteries of a Mahindra e2o, for instance, are simple enough to be opened and repaired. Technicians who work for the company service centres are equipped with the knowledge, and as more cars hit the second-hand market, spare parts became more readily available. For vehicles bought in the last four years, things are a little different. For one, they are still under the warranty period, and users prefer to take them to the authorised service centres. Alan, who runs his garage in Ernakulam, said that he had only worked on one Ola Electric battery, which had been damaged by rat bites and wasnt covered under warranty. The battery cost [to replace] was so expensive, the customer said I would rather purchase an ICE scooter for that much, he said. In many cases, a complete replacement of the pack may not be warranted, and replacing individual cells that have degraded, could increase the life and range of the battery. The question is, will this still be possible in the next ten years? The repair space currently is dominated by third-party workshops and centres. However, they do not have access to developing technology and R&D by OEMs. Getting their hands on spare parts of cells used by market leaders like Tata Motors in their battery packs is also very difficult since they arent made available in the open market, Anurag Sharma, CEO of EV service company India EV Garage explained. What is available is either cheaper Chinese cells or second-hand discards that garages might get their hands on. They also dont have access to diagnostic vehicle data, which could explain exactly what the issue is. Globally, repair shops have been fighting automakers for access to this data. In India too, this is a key drawback for independent service centres. Sharma and his team have worked on repairing batteries of various two-wheelers and Mahindra e20s, Mahindra Reva, and the older version of the Tata Tigor EV since 2021. They source cells either via Chinese imports or through second-hand or discarded batteries of older EVs. Globally, there is also a growing concern about batteries being made nearly impossible to repair. Teslas structural battery packs are made in a way that they are a part of the car, making it very hard to remove or repair them. Alan said that batteries by two-wheeler maker Pure EV are made with a silicon coating and are not repairable. While the company made headlines in 2021 for coming up with an AI-driven solution to automatically repair batteries, Alan said he has 25 unrepairable, unusable battery packs lying in his garage. People have just left them here, he said. For cars from companies like Tata Motors, battery packs are more complicated than earlier models used by Mahindra & Mahindra cars, Sharma said. They are made with updated safety measures  with coolants and temperature sensors and are sealed. We cant confirm the structure of these battery packs because they arent open sourceif someone doesnt have warranty and wants us to replace a module, it is possible but we need the cells from the company as well, he said. The Core reached out to Ather Energy, Tata Motors and Pure EV for comment but did not get a response. Many manufacturers across the world also activelydiscourage repairing batteries citing safety concerns. It is like repairing a bomb, Alan joked. Special insulated tools and equipment, plus expertise is needed to avoid injuries. A lithium-ion battery pack is essentially made up of several individual cells, connected and arranged in modules, put together along with a BMS. Weve earlier written in detail how a battery pack is assembled. When a battery pack is charged and discharged, all the cells dont degrade equally. Some might degrade way more quickly than others. Replacing these cells, with cells that better match the age and degradation of the rest of the pack, increases the life of the pack. Adding an active cell balancer, as Halim did, ensures that there isnt too much disparity in cell degradation. It is way cheaper to repair a battery than to replace it. Not only that, but it is also more sustainable. While a replaced battery pack lands up in a recycling facility, repairing a pack extends the process and also saves energy and resources that would go into making a new pack, and recycling the old one before its time. But with more batteries being replaced than repaired, the world will likely end up with more EV battery scrap, something it has already struggled to successfully dispose of. While a replaced battery pack lands up in a recycling facility, repairing a pack extends the process and also saves energy and resources that would go into making a new pack, and recycling the old one before its time. There are strict rules around lithium-ion battery waste disposal. According to Indias Battery Waste Management Rules from 2022, 90% of discarded materials must be recycled and recovered by 2026, with 20% going into new batteries by 2030. Battery recycling is a capital-intensive process, and recyclers currently struggle with logistical hurdles. One of the primary challenges we currently face is the collection of battery scrap. The unorganised nature of the market complicates the efficient retrieval of these valuable resources, Vikrant Singh, Co-Founder & CTO OF battery recycling company BatX Energies toldThe Core in an email response. Recyclers like BatX are currently focused on electronics scrap. From 2026 onwards, we anticipate a significant shift towards EV batteries, Singh said, adding that they also expect the industry to formalise soon. While early adopters are known to have repaired EV batteries at third-party workshops for a fraction of the cost, new users may find it harder to do so.",

Of this, Rs. 333.39 crore is earmarked for electric two-wheelers, while the rest is allocated for electric three-wheelers. Rs. 10,000 Benefit for Electric Scooters Under the EMPS, each electric scooter will receive a benefit of Rs. 10,000, with a total of 3,33,387 units eligible for the scheme. Effective from April 1 to July 31, the scheme aims to boost electric vehicle sales across manufacturers, dealerships, and end buyers. As the FAME II subsidy concludes this month, the EMPS provides an interim support mechanism until further government decisions on electric vehicle subsidies. In January 2024, EV brands sold 81,343 electric two-wheeler units (26% YoY growth), followed by 81,963 units in February 2024 (24% YoY). The Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) could sustain this momentum in EV sales. April 2024 sales will determine its impact. In recent months, electric two-wheeler sales surged due to manufacturers offering cheaper models and various benefit schemes amid the removal of state subsidies, leading to price hikes. Additionally, concerns over the potential elimination of the Fame-II subsidy drove sales growth. The introduction of the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) aims to bolster buyer confidence, as its criteria align with existing schemes. This eliminates the need for manufacturers to modify their products for EMPS eligibility. However, it remains unclear whether EV brands must recertify their offerings to comply with the new schemes standards.

BMW’s China-specific car criticised on national show over defects,"BMW 530Li, which has been specifically designed for the Chinese market, was criticised at a show aired on World Consumer Rights Day every year in China. The show, broadcast on China Central Television, said consumers filed persistent complaints against abnormal sounds from the car's propeller shaft. It added that BMW hasn't provided satisfying solutions to the complaints.",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/china-s-name-and-shame-event-calls-out-bmw-for-technical-issues?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- BMW AG was named at an annual show airing consumer complaints about technical issues and shoddy services, just as legacy automakers fight intense competition from local rivals. The televised program  called the 315 Gala that runs on Worlds Consumer Rights Day every year  criticized the German automaker for technical defects on its BMW 530Li, according to the broadcast on China Central Television Friday. The premium sedan is specifically designed for the Chinese market. Consumers filed persistent complaints against abnormal sounds from the models propeller shaft, the broadcaster said. The company and local dealers didnt provide satisfying solutions to the issue which incurred both safety concerns and potential harm to the residential value of the car, it said. The name-and-shame show aims to uncover unfair company practices in a nation of 1.4 billion consumers and is closely watched by foreign companies. Besides being a public relations headache, the program has also sparked regulatory investigations and public apologies from executives in past years, including Apple Inc.s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Jaguar Land Rovers parent, Tata Motors Ltd. BMW responded on its official Weibo account - the equivalent of X in China - that it has made technical checks on the reported issue to ensure it doesnt affect driving safety. The company is further analysing the problem to give a satisfying response to consumers, it said, and apologized for the inconvenience. While the 315 gala touts itself as a watchdog for consumer interests, its also seen as a yardstick for greater scrutiny or displeasure from the Chinese government. BMW sold almost 825,000 BMW and Mini vehicles in China last year, accounting for almost a third of global deliveries. Even as deliveries rose, international automakers including BMW are losing market share to local manufacturers such as BYD Co. The shows public impact has weakened in recent years with few major brands targeted. Younger Chinese consumers are also more likely to air their grievances on social media in real time, instead of relying on a once-a-year program. The key theme for this years show is to build integrity and safety, focusing on areas including food safety, finance security and online data fraud.

Gujarati Family Takes 1950 Vintage Car on a 13500 km Road Trip!,"Gujarat's Daman Thakore and his family drove their classic 1950 MG YT on a 13,500 km road trip from Ahmedabad to London spanning 16 countries. To the urbane traveller, this would seem insane. But as Daman rightly points out, ""Nothing about this trip was normal."" Here's a look at their lifechanging journey in the 'Lal Pari'.",https://www.thebetterindia.com/342428/gujarat-daman-thakore-family-drives-vintage-car-from-ahmedabad-to-london-europe-road-trip/amp/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Gujarat's Daman Thakore and his family drove their classic 1950 MG YT on a 13,500 km road trip from Ahmedabad to London spanning 16 countries. Here's a look at their lifechanging journey in the 'Lal Pari'. Krystelle Dsouza What do you think was the first thing that an Ahmedabad-based businessman did when he decided to take a road trip? Well, he did what any of us would  put his start and stop locations in Google Maps. But heres the thing. The end location he put was London! And you can only imagine the result Google Maps rendered. 'Back To My Childhood': Kerala Man Turned a Barren Mining Site Into a Forest With Mud Homestays While many would rethink this brave feat around the globe, Daman Thakore was excited by the prospect. Driving through the breezy spring countryside or through the unforgivingly harsh,scorching deserts, this journey had been what this avid adventurer had dreamt of doing on his 50th birthday. And to simply have an adventure and do what few others have attempted before was alluring in its own way. Doing it with Lal Pari  a vintage UK-made 1950 MG YT manufactured 73 years ago, a part of his family since 1979  was the icing on the cake. In fact, as Daman interjects, the trip was a treat for Lal Pari (red fairy). The car was manufactured in a factory in Abingdon, UK, and we planned the trip with that as the final destination in mind. It was a sort of homecoming for her. Driving across continents is tough. But packing for the trip is a tougher feat. Damans instructions to his six companions were clear. Pack three sets of clothes and wear the fourth. But carry plenty of food. Planning a Monsoon Vacation? Enjoy The Rains At These 8 Homestays Across India To the urbane traveller, this would seem insane. But as Daman rightly points out, Nothing about this trip was normal. And so armed with the said duffle bags, and 80 kg of food, the family plodded from horizon to horizon. It took around 11 months of planning for the trip, and test drives around Gujarat to ensure Lal Pari was ready for the long ride that awaited. Fortunately, says Daman, driving licences werent a problem as hed already procured an international license prior to the trip that was valid across countries.Each country they entered had local road tax and insurance charges that they needed to pay.  A Couple's Search for Slow, Sustainable Life & A Wooden Cottage in The 'Queen of Hills' Finally, the journey across time was set to begin from Mumbai on the Indian Independence Day, 2023. Breaking down the route, Daman says, We left from Ahmedabad on 12 August. On 15 August we undertook the sea route from Mumbai to Dubai where we reached on 28 August. Once in Dubai, we hit the road and reached the UK on 26 October. In total, the journey took us 76 days. Putting their faith in the most feasible route suggested by Google Maps, they embarked on their trip. The Dubai to London route was what we settled on after exploring several different routes, including ones through Russia, Daman notes. Through the time spent in the two and a half months driving through 16 countries, Daman and his family have watched the world through a window, literally and metaphorically. Landscapes changed, time zones shifted, we watched it all in real-time, he says gazing off into the distance. And Im sure that he is mentally still in those lands he speaks of so fondly. But how much did this mind-boggling trip cost, you may ask? Roughly the cost of a Mercedes, Daman says cheekily. As a child, Daman never saw Lal Pari as a car. My mother would tell me these stories of how Lal Pari had superpowers and could come to save us whenever we needed. I grew up believing that. All my favourite memories have been in this car, Daman adds. These include trips to the zoo when he was younger, family trips when he was older, and eventually his marriage. So, it only seemed right that the car was his companion on this dreamy adventure. Navigating across the world on an impulse and high adrenaline means figuring out where your next lunch is going to be, hoping to find a petrol pump in a remote village where water is gold, and driving towards the next destination with hope, even when the road gets tough. But through it all, Lal Pari was very well-behaved. Before embarking on this daring tryst, only the carburettor was changed. Better fuel efficiency and more reliability, you see, he adds. Brothers' 17th Century Haveli Offers 200-YO Recipes, Jawai Leopard Trails & Village Walks The rest of the car, the engine, the gearbox, and the decor were preserved. Every dawn was a new village, every dusk a new countryside, and every day the family would pray to the weather gods to be kind and for any medical emergency to be averted. Of course, we had our fair share of bad weather, says Daman. But we improvised. He recalls the early days of the trip when the weather was warm and half-sleeve t-shirts were the norm for the group. But as we drove through Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia and Croatia, it began getting cold. When we reached Switzerland, France, Italy and the UK, it was raining! So, what did the family do? We wore our raincoats and continued driving, laughs Daman. We knew it wasnt going to be sunshine and rainbows all the time, he adds. And so the family of seven, Daman, his wife, his 75-year-old father, his 21-year-old daughter, a photographer friend, and an uncle, drove to the edge of the world with a support vehicle behind that held the luggage. Uncertainty seemed to be the theme of every day. But no one was complaining. Recalling a nerve-wracking episode they had when they crossed the Turkey border, Daman shares how they were set to reach their pre-booked stay in the morning, but reached at 3:30 am. The designated guy wasnt answering. We couldnt manage to book any new place. So, we drove around in the car until we managed to find somewhere to stay! A gamble with fate is what the trip was. Throughout the journey, the only thing we were sure about was our direction, Daman adds. But even in the face of changing climes and uncertain destinations, Daman says the incredible love they received from people served as their compass. Peoples fondness for India shone through, Daman recalls when Mr Omidvar (a gentleman they met in Tehran) sang the Indian national anthem  which he had learnt on his trip to India in 1953  to perfection. The group recalls watching with goosebumps. Daman was fascinated when he told the group about his own expedition in 1953 where he rode around the world on a motorbike. Here I was with gadgets, Google Maps, a phone, technology and the latest roads. But this man had done it at a time when none of this existed, he says. The love for India only became more evident as the group neared their destination. In Bulgaria, we stopped for engine oil at a small village which is home to one of the most orthodox churches in the world. A woman in her fifties asked us to accept the fuel for free. The fact that we were Indians got us this favour. As the woman explained, her love for India had led her to memorise the Bhagwad Gita and the Ramayana. She was well-versed in Sanskrit and was a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan. And youll be surprised to know she had never been to India, emphasises Daman. The country has goodwill across the world, he adds. And kindness never left the familys side. When in the UK, Daman recounts how a man named Anil helped him through a sticky spot. My car had broken down and it was very expensive to hire a pickup truck there. I had visited Anil for a few car-related things the previous day and as soon as the car broke down, I asked him if he could send someone to help. Not only did Anil drive 600 miles to help but did not charge a penny for it. Yesterday when you drove Lal Pari to my garage, you brought a smile to my sons face. I cannot charge you, was Anils excuse. But whats more fascinating is the number of people Daman met through this incredible journey that they undertook  fifty thousand people and counting! And when he finally reached the destination, the exhilaration was visible. In fact, the start of the journey was equally emotional. It was something Id been dreaming of for the longest time and to get out in Dubai and onto the road was amazing, he says. It was during the documentation process and obtaining a carnet de passage (passport for the car that enables it to travel across countries) that they learnt that they were one of the first Indians to undertake an expedition of this kind. Doing the trip with my family added to the magic, Daman says. There was so much joy when we accomplished it, and a feeling of gratitude to be able to do what many may have dreamt of. That being said, he adds that the magic of travel evokes a unanimous feeling. It is ingrained in our DNA. Whether it was Vasco da Gama exploring the world, or you and I, travel is intrinsic to our existence, he adds. Today, Lal Pari is back in Damans garage in their Ahmedabad home after the long and telling adventure shes been on. I dont know if its just my imagination but it seems like Lal Pari is shining a little bit brighter, ready for the next exciting adventure.

This is why electric bike taxis are banned in Bengaluru,"Find out how Karnataka has banned all Electric bike taxis in the state. Despite efforts to regulate the sector, challenges exists, leading to the withdrawal of the Electric Bike Taxi Scheme. However, this decision contrasts with a recent advisory from the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways supporting bike taxis.",https://trak.in/stories/this-is-why-electric-bike-taxis-are-now-banned-in-bengaluru/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh Mar 10, 2024 The withdrawal of the Electric Bike Taxi Scheme by the Karnataka government has sparked debate and raised concerns about the future of eco-friendly transportation solutions in the state. Launched in 2021 with the aim of enhancing first and last-mile connectivity and generating employment opportunities, the scheme faced opposition from auto-rickshaw unions in Bengaluru. Why Ban? The decision to ban electric bike taxis stems from various factors highlighted in a notification issued by the state transport department. Concerns were raised about private app-based organizations utilizing non-transport two-wheelers in violation of the Motor Vehicle Act. Instances of heated disputes between auto and taxi drivers and bike taxi riders led to law and order issues, raising significant concerns about womens safety. Additionally, the unauthorized operation of bike taxis has impacted the tax collection and enforcement efforts of the transport department. Auto Unions Objected Sources indicate that opposition from auto-rickshaw unions played a significant role in influencing the governments decision. Persistent demands for a ban on bike taxis and instances of intimidation against bike taxi riders further fueled the controversy. Despite efforts to regulate the sector, including granting licenses to certain operators, challenges persisted, with some aggregators operating without approval. In contrast to the state governments decision, a recent advisory from the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) supports the concept of bike taxis. The advisory encourages states and union territories to accept and process applications for contract carriage permits for motorcycles under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and its rules. While the Electric Bike Taxi Scheme was introduced with noble intentions, challenges related to regulatory compliance, safety concerns, and opposition from vested interests have led to its withdrawal. The ban on electric bike taxis in Karnataka underscores the complex dynamics and competing interests in the transportation sector, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes both innovation and regulatory oversight.

Electric cars 1850-times more polluting than petrol/diesel cars,"A recent study by Emission Analytics reveals that electric vehicles (EVs) emit 1,850 times more particulate matter from brakes and tires compared to gas-powered cars due to heavier batteries. Despite EVs' environmental benefits, the report highlights concerns about faster deterioration and chemical release from battery wear.",https://trak.in/stories/electric-cars-are-1850-times-more-polluting-than-petrol-diesel-cars-as-per-new-study/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh Mar 10, 2024 As per a recent study by Emission Analytics, the batteries of electric vehicles are heavier than petrol engines which in turn puts more weight on brakes and tyres which further releases more particulate matter from brakes and tyres as compared to modern gas-powered counterparts. As per the study, the particulate matter emission could be 1,850 times greater. EVs cause 1850 times Particulate Matter Emission Immense interest has been generated in the environment-friendly transportation choices and it is a widely accepted notion that the EVs are better for the environment than petrol and diesel cars due to the fact that they produce lesser greenhouse gases. The report says that the heavier batteries cause the EV to deteriorate faster by accelerating wear and tear and then release harmful chemicals into air, what makes the scenario all the more precarious is that most of the tyres are made up of synthetic rubber which in turn is derived from crude oil. Global Electric Vehicle Adoption Outlook Reports cited the example of Tesla Model Y and the Ford F-150 Lightning which have batteries that weigh around 1,800 pounds. As per the study, the tyre wear emissions from an electric car with half ton battery is 400 times than its petrol counterpart. As per the Bloomberg, Uber has planned that by 2030, all its vehicles in US, Canada & European cities shall be 100% electric. Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber said that The stark reality is that Uber will not reach our zero-emission goals without stronger action from policymakers and businesses. Unfortunately, right at the moment we need to accelerate through the turn, many governments and automakers are slowing down, he added.

6-seater elevated pod taxis approved between Bandra-Kurla,"MMRDA approves the introduction of pod taxis along an 8.8-kilometer stretch between Bandra and Kurla via BKC to alleviate traffic congestion.

The driverless pod taxi system, already operational in various global locales, aims to provide commuters with a convenient and efficient mode of transport. Revolutionizing Public Transit in Mumbai Pod taxis, akin to ropeway systems, will navigate an overhead rail, ferrying up to five to six passengers each. Running on electricity, these futuristic pods will glide 8-10 meters above ground, descending and ascending at designated stations for passenger boarding and alighting. This initiative, previously shelved in 2017, is now being revived under a public-private partnership (PPP) model, promising enhanced connectivity for employees of multinational corporations, commercial establishments, and government offices situated in and around BKC. The project, with an estimated cost yet to be disclosed, is strategically aligned with MMRDAs objective to decongest BKC, a hub housing key institutions such as the US Consulate, suburban railway stations, the National Stock Exchange, and corporate offices. With 38 planned stops and a speed of 40 kmph, the pod taxi service aims to provide commuters with a seamless and efficient alternative to traditional modes of transport. Elevated stations, meticulously designed to complement the architectural landscape, will occupy minimal space, ensuring minimal disruption to the existing urban fabric. The integration of pod taxis into Mumbais public transit ecosystem aligns with broader infrastructure initiatives, including the forthcoming Metro Line 2B and the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, aimed at offering commuters a comprehensive and interconnected network of transit options.

To ensure your vehicle and phone remain safe, here are some ways to protect it during the Holi season.",https://www.indiatimes.com/amp/lifestyle/self/protect-car-phone-from-holi-stains-629089.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The Indiatimes.com Privacy Policy has been updated to align with the new data regulations in European Union. Please review and accept these changes below to continue using the website. We use cookies to ensure the best experience for you on our website. As the vibrant festival of colors, Holi, approaches, it's essential to take precautions to safeguard your prized possession - your car and your smartphone. The splashing of colors and water can pose a threat to your gadgets, potentially causing damage that could affect its appearance and value. To ensure your vehicle and phone remain safe and retain its original color during the festivities, here are some effective ways to protect it during the Holi season.  Holi celebration Apply glycerin or moisturiser: Applying a layer of glycerin or moisturizer to your earphones before Holi celebrations can help protect them from potential damage and color stains. This protective barrier not only shields the earphones but also makes it easier to remove any color residue once the festivities are over. Use ziplock bags: Placing your phone, smartwatch, smart band, or any other gadget inside a waterproof pouch or airtight ziplock bag is one of the simplest and most effective ways to safeguard them during Holi celebrations. This protective barrier prevents water and colors from penetrating the device, ensuring its safety and functionality throughout the festivities.Also, to safeguard the speakers of your phone or other gadgets when they are covered with duct tape or kept inside a ziplock bag, remember to switch them to silent mode. This precaution prevents any potential damage to the speakers and ensures that they remain in optimal condition during the Holi festivities. Use pattern lock:To maintain security and access your phone without hassle during Holi celebrations, consider using the pattern lock feature. If your phone is covered with a ziplock bag or color, fingerprint recognition may not function properly. In such cases, relying on a PIN or pattern lock ensures seamless access to your device, allowing you to enjoy the festivities without concern about fingerprint recognition issues. Don't charge when phone is wet:Charging wet electronic devices is a risky move that can result in permanent damage or, worse, electric shock. It's best to exercise caution and patience, allowing the device to thoroughly dry before attempting to charge it. By prioritizing safety over convenience, you can protect both your device and yourself from potential harm.  Credit: Canva Cover it up: Protecting your car during Holi can be as simple as covering it with a car cover. Many carmakers provide covers for their vehicles, which can often be found in the boot. If not, car covers are readily available at car accessory stores and dealerships. Investing in a cover and keeping your car under wraps is a straightforward and effective way to shield it from Holi colors and water damage. Coat it with wax or Teflon:Adding a protective layer to your car's surface, whether through a wax coating or Teflon treatment, can provide valuable defense against Holi colors and water damage. Applying wax coating or Teflon can be done at home and creates a barrier that prevents colors and particles from adhering to the paint surface. In case colors do stick, a thorough wash can effectively remove them without damaging the paint.  freepik Keep windows rolled up: While cleaning the exterior of the car after Holi is relatively straightforward, tackling the interior can pose challenges. To prevent color stains and damage to seat upholstery, particularly if it's fabric, it's best to keep your car windows rolled up during celebrations. This precautionary measure helps safeguard light-colored interior surfaces from potential marks and ensures easier cleanup post-Holi festivities. Keep towels in car: After Holi celebrations, it's essential to clean yourself as thoroughly as possible before entering your car to minimize color transfer. Keeping towels in the car can aid in this process, allowing you to wipe off excess color and moisture from your body. Additionally, placing towels on the car seats before sitting can provide an added layer of protection, helping safeguard the upholstery from potential stains.

The CV business and its related investments will be housed in one entity, while the other will include passenger cars, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover, according to an exchange filing on Monday. The demerger proposalwhich will be presented to the board of directors in the coming months and subject to necessary regulatory and shareholder approvalsis likely to be completed in 1215 months. Shareholders of Tata Motors will continue to have identical shareholding in both the listed entities, the filing stated, and itll be business as usual post-demerger. The three automotive business units are now operating independently and are delivering consistent performance, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman at Tata Motors, said in the statement. This demerger will help them better capitalise on the opportunities provided by the market by enhancing their focus and agility. This will lead to a superior experience for our customers, better growth prospects for our employees, and enhanced value for our shareholders. The Tata Motors stock has been on a tear over the past couple of months, so much so that the Nexon SUV maker emerged as India's most valuable carmaker, building on the outsized sales of its carstraditional and electricand outperformance by Jaguar Land Rover. In 2023, its monthly sales often rivalled those of Indias second-largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd. The company sold 5,50,871 cars all of last yeara growth of 4.6% over the previous yeareven as Hyundai India shipped 6,02,111 units. Tata Motors is the clear leader in the electric mobility space, accounting for nearly three out of four electric cars sold in the country. Additionally, the company is planning to invest as much as $2 billion in electric models by 2027. Jaguar Land Rover, which at present retails only one electric SUV, plans to launch the first electric Range Rover this year and has already had more than 16,000 sign-ups for the model since opening the waiting list last year, Bloomberg reported. Tata Group is also building a 4 billion battery plant in the UK, which has Tata Motors and JLR as anchor customers. On Nov. 29, 2023, group firm Tata Technologies Ltd. debuted on the stock exchanges with the best listing day gains for an Indian stock. Clearly, the demerger is a case of value-unlocking. The demerger is an excellent move and will be leveraged at both operational and financial levels, according to Gurmeet Chadha, managing partner at Complete Circle. This move will lead to more value creation in different subsidiaries and have the business in focus. According to Deven Choksey of KRChoksey Investments, the PV businessparticularly the EV segmentis demanding more investment. This demerger is a value-unlocking proposition... It looks like an extremely promising prospect for investors. The demerger reflects confidence in the mainstay business. This (the demerger) signifies the managements confidence that the two businesses can operate independently with self-sustaining cash flows, Emkay Global said in a note. And while the brokerage does not see any major fundamental changes, it has revised its SOTP-based target price marginally to Rs 950 from Rs 925 earlier, factoring in a 10% premium multiple to the CV business. The recent run-up in the stock price limits upside. The demerger also plays into Tata Motors debt picture. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Tata Motors had a net automotive debt of Rs 29,200 crore even as the free cash flow has improvedRs 6,400 crore in Q3 FY24 from Rs 5,300 crore a year ago. At JLR, free cash flow stood at 626 million in Q3 FY24 and 1.4 billion in the nine months to Dec. 31, even as debt almost halved year-on-year to 1.6 billion, according to the companys third-quarter financials. On our net debt journey, I expect Tata Motors domestic business to become near net debt zero in FY24 and JLR the following year, Chandra had said at the car companys annual general meeting in August last year. As of Dec. 31, Tata Motors had a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.58, down from 3.68 a year earlier. Then theres the matter of synergies. According to Tata Motors, the demerger is a natural progression of the subsidiarisation in 2022. While there are limited synergies in the CV space, there is considerable overlap in the PV businessfor example, JLRs electrified modular platform will underpin Tata Motors EV-first models under the Avinya brand. The current generation of the Harrier and Safari SUVs is built on an old Land Rover chassis. Shares of Tata Motors have more than doubled in the past year, making it the NSE Nifty 50s top performer. Year-to-date, the stock is up 27%, making it more valuable than Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. On Monday, the stock ended 0.12% lower at Rs 987.20 apiece. Of the 34 analysts tracking the company, 26 recommend a buy rating, five suggest a hold and three have a sell call, according to Bloomberg. The average of twelve-month analyst price targets implies a potential downside of 3.6%.",
"Tata Motors to demerge into commercial, passenger vehicle units",Tata Motors has decided to demerge itself into two listed entities - a commercial vehicles (CV) unit and a passenger vehicles (PV) unit. The PV unit will include the automaker's EV and Jaguar Land Rover businesses too. Existing shareholders of the firm will continue to hold identical shareholding in both the listed entities. The demerger will take 12-15 months.,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/tata-motors-to-spin-off-car-truck-units-into-separate-listed-companies?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Tata Motors Ltd. has approved a proposal to split the company into two separate listed entities for passenger and commercial vehicles as it looks to boost growth and improve accountability. For every share held in Tata Motors, investors will get one share each of the new listed entities, an exchange filing said on Monday. ""The demerger will be implemented through an NCLT scheme of arrangement."" This move will empower both entities to pursue their respective strategies to deliver higher growth with greater agility while reinforcing accountability, the company said. Passenger vehicles, including British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, accounted for 79% of the company's Rs 3,41,544 crore revenue in FY23, while commercial vehicles contributed 21%.

Bengaluru-based automaker Ather Energy, known for relatively fewer such incidents, faced a notable event when a video surfaced online showing several of its scooters ablaze inside a transport truck. Incident Details and Online Reaction The video, shared on X by Ather Energy Parody, depicted four Ather Energy scooters engulfed in flames atop a transport truck, prompting concerns about the companys safety standards.  Ather Electric scooters caught fire during . It's concerning that Ather Electric faces issues almost every day #ather #atherelectric @atherenergy pic.twitter.com/fZnHmvxfNA However, four other scooters on the lower section remained unaffected. While the cause of the fire is yet to be officially confirmed, speculation suggests a possible electrical short-circuit due to contact with a live wire. Investigation and Potential Causes Ather Energy has not released an official statement regarding the incident. However, reports indicate that a crack in the battery casing, likely sustained from a prior accident, allowed water to seep in during a routine wash, potentially triggering the fire. Further investigation is needed to ascertain the precise cause and assess the companys response to prevent such incidents in the future.

"Rs 1000 penalty can be imposed, even if you are wearing helmet","New road safety rule mandates wearing a helmet while riding, imposing a fine of Rs. 2000 for non-compliance.

But heres the catch, even if the rider wears a helmet, a fine can be levied if the helmet is not properly secured with its belt or if it is defective. In the latter, a fine of Rs 1000 will be imposed. Helmet Enforcement and A Fine of Rs 2000 The fundamental objective behind the same is to promote the road safety and also reduce the road accidents by ensuring that the riders wear helmet as well as follow traffic regulations. In order to prevent the rider and/or the pillion from potential injuries in case of accidents, such a law can turn to be instrumental. Stricter Penalties for Overloading as per New Motor Vehicle Act There is one more change in the new Motor Vehicle Act, wherein a penalty of Rs 20,000 shall be levied for overloading the vehicles and violating the rules. Emphasizing the importance of following the regulations, there shall be an additional fine of Rs 2000 per tonne for overloading. As per the data provided by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of India, in the year 2017, more than 48,746 two-wheeler users died in road mishaps. Out of these, 73.8% did not wear a helmet.

Each month, automobile makers in India release wholesale numbers - or vehicle sales to dealers. Tata Motors reported a 19% year-on-year rise in its passenger vehicle (PV) sales for the month, higher than the 12% rise in January, while Toyota's Indian unit posted record sales for the second consecutive month at 25,220 units, up almost 61% from last year. Its sports utility vehicles (SUV) and multi-utility vehicle models were ""at the forefront of this demand surge"", said Toyota. Analysts have noted that the volume rise in PVs such as sedans, SUVs and others was likely due to high inventory levels and a rise in discounts. Mahindra and Mahindra, one of India's largest SUV makers by revenue, said its SUV sales rose 40% in February, pushing total sales up 24%. Domestic two-wheeler (2W) sales also rose, supported by improved demand and new product launches. Analysts expect healthy momentum to persist in the absence of a price hike for at least three months. Eicher Motors' premium motorcycle Royal Enfield sold 75,935 units in the month from 71,544 units a year ago. It reported an uptick of 2% in the sale of motorcycles with an engine capacity of up to 350cc, compared to a 1% fall in January. Bajaj Auto's total 2W sales for the month rose 25% to 294,684 units.

This real-world test echoes Teslas claims about the Cybertrucks durability and resistance to small firearms, initially showcased during its unveiling. Shot up my Tesla truck todayIts definitely bullet proof. I love this truck.

Ross first used a 9mm semi-automatic submachine gun to fire at his Cybertruck. Following this, he escalated the experiment by using a shotgun. Videos of both tests were shared, showing the aftermath of the ordeal. Here he is shooting a shotgun!!! Damn these cyber trucks are built right! pic.twitter.com/EbK0F54lk4  Jay of House Mader (@house_mader) February 21, 2024  The Cybertruck sustained significant surface damage from the gunfire; however, consistent with Teslas claims, the bullets did not penetrate the vehicles exterior, except for one round that hit a gap between the doors. This outcome highlights the Cybertrucks robust design, featuring ultra-hard 30x cold-rolled stainless steel, significantly thicker than standard steel used in most vehicles. Teslas Cybertruck boasts an exterior made from a 3mm thick stainless steel sheet, designed to offer enhanced protection compared to the conventional 0.7-1 millimeter thickness found in typical steel door panels. While the test showed resistance to 9 MM, .45 caliber, and some shotgun rounds, its important to note that the vehicles armor isnt designed to withstand high-powered firearms. Its crucial to emphasize that such tests are highly dangerous and should not be replicated. Firearms should be handled only by trained professionals in controlled environments. This experiment was conducted by an individual without apparent extensive firearms training, as noted by his reaction to the shotguns recoil and handling during the test. The Takeaway The Cybertrucks performance in this unconventional test provides a tangible demonstration of its defensive capabilities, aligning with Teslas durability promises. However, the primary focus remains on its innovative design, electric efficiency, and contribution to sustainable transportation, rather than its potential in ballistic resistance.",

Electric scooters are choking oil’s boom market,"Life moves pretty fast. That's especially true in India's booming cities. The place where road transport is shifting most rapidly to battery power isn't Oslo or Shenzhen, but Delhi. E-rickshaws took a 54% share of India's three-wheeler market last year, driven by zippy, longer-range models and running costs that are a fraction of petroleum-powered alternatives.",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/india-s-ev-revolution-is-spreading-from-auto-rickshaws-to-motorbikes?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Life moves pretty fast. Thats especially true in Indias booming cities. A decade ago, the countrys iconic auto-rickshawshad three wheels anda diesel engine. Battery-powered versions existed, but only enough to be seen as a novelty and  unregulated threat. Officially, just 12 e-rickshaws were sold nationwidein 2014.(1) How far weve come. The place where road transport is shifting most rapidly to battery power isnt Oslo or Shenzhen, but Delhi. E-rickshaws took a 54% share of Indiasthree-wheeler market last year, driven by zippy, longer-range models and running costs that are a fraction of petroleum-powered alternatives. Visiting the country last week, one of the first stops for Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi was to  get behind the wheel of aMahindra & Mahindra Ltd. electric three-wheeler and promise an expansion into two- and three-wheeled ride-hailing. Those bettingIndia will come to the rescue of flailing global oil demand (its reckoned to be the  biggest source of consumption growth between now and 2030, outstripping even China)need to reckon with how things are changing on the streets. Theres no mystery why e-rickshaws have been taking over. Buy a BajajMaximawith an engine and youll pay about threerupees per kilometer (5.8cents per mile)for diesela significant slice of earnings thataverage out around 10 rupeesper kilometer. A Piaggio Ape E City with a lithium-ion battery charged at home, on the other hand, might cost just 0.27 rupees per kilometer. As a result, e-rickshaws arent just cleaner and quieter theyre moreprofitable, too. Thats a decisive consideration for driverswho are usuallyrural migrants trying to get a foothold in the big city. If this revolution was confined only to three-wheelers, it wouldnt be much to get excited about. Auto-rickshaws are a highly distinctive part of Indias road fleet, but not a very significant one. Trucks and cars are sold in far greater numbers, whilemore than 70% of vehicle sales are two-wheeled scooters and motorbikes. However, the hard financial logic thats caused e-rickshaws to take over is starting to play out on two wheels, too. Manufacturers are currently launching a slew of new models with price tags and performance to compete with conventional bikes and scooters that retail for less than 100,000 rupees($1,200). With gasoline prices up about a third thanks to the rise in crudesince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, that could sparka stampede like the one thattransformed the e-rickshaw market. Only about 5% of two-wheelers sold last year were battery-powered. McKinsey & Co. forecasts that figure will hit 60% to 70% by 2030. The industry is going through a price war,Swadesh Srivastava, the head of bike-maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd.s emerging mobility unit, told an investor call Feb. 10. Heros main domestic two-wheeler rivalTVS Motor Co. plans to offer models this year in every segment of the market, from premium to basic, and will expand its dealership network from 400 cities to 800over the three months through March. That could start to cause real pain for oil producers whove mostly shrugged off the e-rickshaw revolution. Only about 1.4% of Indias gasoline and diesel is consumed by three-wheelers, but two-wheelers gulp down about 17% of the total. The International Energy Agencys latest estimates for the countrys oil demand are already being trimmed. Its  latest report reckons 6.6 million barrels a day will be consumed in 2030 above 5.5 million barrels last year, but welldown from a central forecast of 6.8 million daily barrels in  its global outlook last October. The real prize lies beyond two wheels, however. The biggest polluters by far onIndias roads arent two- or three-wheelers buttrucks, which consume nearly half of all gasoline and diesel. Trucks arenormally seen as the hardest segment for EVs to crack. The biggest rigsare simply too energy-hungry to be powered by a battery. Even smaller ones are worked hard day and night forthin margins, making it difficultto spare the time to charge up theirpower packs. Even here, though, the sands are shifting.Tata Motors Ltd. launched its first small electric truck in 2022 while Mahindra, the leading e-rickshaw producer,is planning to  release a rangein 2025. Truck owners, like rickshaw drivers, are intensely sensitive to the combined costs of purchase, refueling and maintenance  and manufacturers seem onthe cusp of hitting their sweet spot. Current e-truckswork out cheaper than diesel models once youve been operating them for five to seven years, Ashok Leyland Ltd. managing director Shenu Agarwal told investors Feb. 6. If we can bring it down below five years, then it will start making much more sense, he said. In the US and Europe, the shift to electric vehicles was a top-down affair, best exemplified by Elon Musks 2006 promise to start by building an electric sports car and then use the profits to make progressively more affordable mass-market vehicles. Well-heeleddrivers cant get enough ofluxury EVs like Porsche AGs Taycan and Rolls-Royces Spectre, while the rest of us are   waiting in vain for the sub-$30,000 city cars we were promised. India seems to be moving in the opposite direction. Electrification of conventionalcars and SUVs is still moving at a snails pace, with battery cars winning just a 2% share of four-wheelers last year. That doesnt matter much in a market thats dominated by smaller vehicles and cost-conscious drivers. When the EV revolution arrives inIndia, it will come from the bottom up.

The Italian sports carmakers global CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, shared with TOI that the majority of Indian buyers are under 40, setting them apart from their counterparts in developed economies. During his visit to India, Winkelmann emphasized the changing landscape, stating that Indians are becoming increasingly adventurous in purchasing supercars across international borders. Despite relatively low sales in the country, with 103 Lamborghinis sold in 2023 compared to 10,000 worldwide, Winkelmann sees massive potential in the Indian market. Interestingly, Winkelmann highlighted a unique trend among Indian buyers who are not only purchasing cars within the country but also acquiring them for properties abroad in the UK, America, Dubai, and Southeast Asia. Moreover, there has been a shift in consumer behavior regarding sports cars. Winkelmann noted that people are now more willing to experience and own these vehicles, which wasnt the case previously.

The incident has sparked discussions about supercar drivability on Indian roads. Was the Italian Supercar damaged? Read on to find out all about the 561hp Bengaluru Supercar,https://www.news9live.com/auto/ferrari-458-italia-jumps-speedbreaker-bangalore-2446329/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"In an event that has caught the eye of automobile enthusiasts across India, a Ferrari 458 Italia, valued at approximately 5 Crore, was recently recorded making an audacious leap over a speed breaker in Bengaluru. The video, which quickly went viral on social media platforms, including Reddit, showcases the high-performance vehicle executing a high-speed maneuver over a speed breaker, a sight rarely witnessed on Indian streets known for their challenging driving conditions. Supercars vs. Indian Roads: An Ongoing Battle The incident brings to light the perennial struggle of navigating supercars on Indian roads, where traffic congestion, undisciplined driving, and poorly maintained road infrastructure, including potholes and inappropriately designed speedbreakers, pose significant challenges. The Ferrari 458 Italias encounter with the speed breaker is proof of the difficulties supercar owners face, highlighting the need for better road maintenance and infrastructure planning. The Prancing Horse Jumps According to eyewitnesses and the video shared, the Ferrari 458 Italia was overtaking a bus through a corner at a considerable speed when it encountered the speedbreaker unexpectedly. The vehicle managed to take the obstacle gracefully, albeit with both front wheels catching air and the front end seemingly scraping the tarmac upon landing. Remarkably, the driver did not slow down after the incident, continuing to drive away. Screengrab of the Viral Ferrari Video shows the Italian Supercar catch air while crossing the speedbreaker with both its front wheels leaving the tarmac. This episode underscores the risks supercar owners take while driving on public roads and serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to speed limits and road safety measures, especially in high-performance vehicles not designed for the unpredictable nature of Indian roadways. About the Ferrari 458 Italia Introduced in 2009 and succeeded by the 488 GTB in 2015, the Ferrari 458 Italia is a marvel of automotive engineering, boasting a 4497 cc engine that propels it from 0100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds, with a top speed exceeding 325 km/h. Despite its impressive capabilities, the supercars low ground clearance makes it particularly vulnerable to damage from road imperfections, as highlighted by the recent incident in Bangalore.

It is easier to get technology partners from south east Asia who are willing to work together."" Kaynes Technology is also investing in a bare board printed circuit board plant with HDI (High-density Interconnect) technology; the company has already raised money for this investment. ""We are actively looking at investment in silicon carbide fab, silicon fab and display fab. The silicon carbide fab will have close to 100 crore investment, the silicon fab will have an European tech partner and display fab will have a Japanese tech partner,"" according to sources aware of the matter. Kaynes Technology is a 38-year-old electronics manufacturing services company with manufacturing infrastructure in Mysuru, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Manesar and Parwanoo with service centers in Mumbai and Kochi. While India has been strong in design, the country would be making strides in fab manufacturing. In December 2021, the Indian government earmarked INR 2,30,000 crore to position India as global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors as the foundational building block. An outlay of INR 76,000 crore was allocated for the development of semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem in India.

Indian consumers' rising preference for Hybrid EVs: Deloitte,"The survey also emphasises the importance of responsible battery management, with customers anticipating proactive measures from vehicle dealers, EV battery manufacturers and battery recycling companies. It also shows a definite preference for hybrid technology in future vehicle purchases, despite ongoing issues with infrastructure availability, battery safety and charging times.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/deloitte-analysis-reveals-indian-consumers-rising/469945?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,". Entrepreneur and its related marks are registered trademarks of Entrepreneur Media LLC                                         Feb 20, 2024                     Share                According to Deloitte's most recent Global Automotive Consumer Study (GACS) for 2024 in the Indian automotive industry development, nearly 50 percent of Indian consumers intend to move away from internal combustion engine (ICE) technology to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as their preferred engine in their next vehicle. This change, which is primarily the result of lower fuel costs and environmental concerns, is significant for the Indian auto industry. Affordability has turned up as a crucial element affecting buying decisions, with 80% of buyers aiming to select a vehicle in the INR 525 lakh price range. The preference percentages for ICE and EV engines under INR 1025 lakh are 59 percent and 58 percent, respectively. Furthermore, 23 percent and 22 percent of consumers preferred ICE and EV automobiles, respectively, in the price range of INR 10 lakh and lower. Approximately 68% of respondents mentioned their awareness of the environment, while 63% voiced their worries on the decreased cost of fuel. The infrastructure for charging also plays a crucial role, with 66% of drivers planning to charge their vehicles at home and 22% at public charging stations. Fast charging is essential, and the majority of customers prefer straightforward credit/debit card payments. The study also emphasises the need for responsible battery management, as consumers expect dedicated battery recycling companies, EV battery manufacturers, and vehicle dealers to take the lead in collecting, storing, and recycling EV batteries. According to the survey, most consumers preference hybrid technology when buying a new vehicle, despite ongoing issues with infrastructure availability, battery safety, and charging times. Rajeev Singh, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Deloitte Asia Pacific, stated, ""Booming economy and the changing consumer preferences indicate the learning effect of 'New' cars over 'Used' and the willingness to invest more in connected cars. This offers original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) a prime opportunity for enhanced customer retention services. Transparency is the key-consumers are ready to pay more if OEMs guide them transparently. ""Despite a positive trend in EV adoption, infrastructure remains crucial for sustainability. Consumers are eco-conscious and look to OEMs committed to sustainability. The stage is set for OEMs to lead with transparency, innovation, and a green commitment, shaping a future aligned with consumer values,"" he added. Apart from the increase in demand for hybrid vehicles, the Deloitte analysis also identifies a number of new trends: 1.

'Mr Bean' actor Rowan Atkinson has been blamed for poor sales of electric cars in a report by the UK's House of Lords. According to Sky News, the actor was name-checked by the House's environment and climate change committee meeting on Tuesday. At the meeting, think tank Green Alliance presented its views on the main obstacles faced by the UK government in phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2035, saying an article written by the actor was damaging to the cause. Mr Atkinson had made the comment in June 2023, according to the outlet. ""One of the most damaging articles was a comment piece written by Rowan Atkinson in The Guardian which has been roundly debunked,"" the think tank was quoted as saying by Sky News. ""Unfortunately, fact checks never reach the same breadth of audience as the original false claim, emphasising the need to ensure high editorial standards around the net zero transition,"" it further told the Upper House of the UK's Parliament. Mr Atkinson's article was titled 'I love electric vehicles - and was an early adopter. But increasingly I feel duped'. In the piece, the 69-year-old wrote that EVs were ""a bit soulless"" and criticised the use of lithium-ion batteries. The article had led to the actor's widespread criticism from advocates of EVs. The Telegraph quoted Simon Evans, of the Carbon Brief website, as saying: ""Mr Atkinson's biggest mistake is his failure to recognise that electric vehicles already offer significant global environmental benefits, compared with combustion-engine cars."" Other deterrents mentioned in Tuesday's report presented before the UK's Parliament were higher purchase costs, insufficient charging infrastructure and mixed messaging. The Telegraph said Mr Atkinson has degrees in electrical engineering and control systems. The actor has so far not reacted to the development.

"Tesla sells 1 EV in S Korea in Jan amid price rise, safety concern","Elon Musk's Tesla sold only one electric vehicle in South Korea in January amid rising safety concerns, price rise, lack of charging infrastructure and more. This marks the worst sales figure since July 2022 when the automaker had sold no vehicles in South Korea. Sale of all EVs fell 80% in January from December in South Korea, data showed.",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/tesla-sold-only-one-car-in-korea-in-january-as-ev-demand-weakens?src=p2&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. sold just one electric vehicle in South Korea in January as a raft of headwinds, from safety concerns to price and a lack of charging infrastructure, weigh on demand. The companys sale of a solitary Model Y SUV was its worst month since July 2022, when the Austin, Texas-based automaker sold no vehicles at all, according to data from Seoul-based researcher Carisyou and the Korean trade ministry. Across all carmakers, the number of new EVs registered in Korea fell 80% in January from December, Carisyou data show. Carmakers are facing a slowdown in enthusiasm for EVs in South Korea as higher interest rates and inflation prompt consumers to rein in spending, while concerns about battery fires and a dearth of fast chargers are also damping demand. Teslas low-selling January marks a major shift for the brand as its China-made Model Y was one of the top sellers last year. Many early adopters have already bought EVs and mass-market consumers arent looking to purchase yet, according to Lee Hang-Koo, head of the Jeonbuk Institute of Automotive Convergence Technology. Teslas popularity is also hurt by its links to China, he said. Most Koreans who wanted to buy Teslas cars have bought one, Lee said. Some people dont like Tesla recently after finding some of them are made in China, with consumers concerned about the quality of manufacturing, he said. Koreas EVs sales are also affected by strong seasonal swings in demand. Many people avoid buying vehicles in January because they want to wait for the governments announcement of subsidies, according to Lee. In a statement to Bloomberg News, a spokesperson for Tesla in Korea said consumers delayed EV purchases before the confirmation of subsidies. Tesla faces headwinds there, too. In July 2023, the company set the selling price of the Chinese-made Model Y at 56,990,000 won ($43,000), bringing it under the threshold of 57 million won that allows cars to qualify for a full government subsidy. In the plan for 2024, announced Tuesday, the level has been lowered to 55 million won, reducing the subsidy for Teslas Model Y by half. --With assistance from Emily Yamamoto.

The surge in shareholder wealth has been driven by buying interest seen in Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors Tata Power and Indian Hotels shares this year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd surged over 9 percent so far in 2024 while Tata Motors Ltd advanced over 20 percent. Tata Power jumped 18 percent while Indian Hotels gained 16 percent. The Tata Group has 24companieslisted on exchanges. Meanwhile, Tejas Network, Tata Elxsi and Tata Chemicals dropped over 10 percent so far this year while the remaining stocks gained in the range of 1-5 percent.  TCS reached a new high on February 6, surging over 4 percent and crossing the market cap of Rs 15 lakh crore. The boost is attributed to encouraging deal wins in Q3FY24, with a total contract value of $8.1 billion, up 3.8 percent from the previous year. The management expressed confidence in long-term growth, anticipating client investments to increase as the challenging macro conditions subside. TCS recently announced a 15-year partnership expansion with Aviva, a UK insurance leader, aiming to transform the ""UK Life business."" Though the deal size is undisclosed, sources suggest it's a mega deal, typically exceeding $500 million. This follows a seasonally weak quarter for TCS with no large reported deals. Tata Motors stock witnessed a surge in the past month driven by strong earningswith contributing factors like the easing impact of semiconductor chip shortage, lower raw material prices and robust demand. The company achieved a notable 27 percent YoY volume growth and a substantial 22 percent YoY revenue growth with the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) division posting a remarkable 16.2 percent EBITDA margin. Despite ongoing chip challenges, JLR's supply has improved, reducing order backlog. The domestic business showed in-line results, with a 19 percent revenue growth and a significant 270-basis point expansion in EBITDA margin. New model launches and strong demand are expected to boost future volumes. The management is optimistic about sustained demand in the Indian market, driven by economic recovery and government emphasis on infrastructure development. The PV business is anticipated to continue its momentum with a projected industry growth of 5-7 percent in FY24, analysts said. Tata Power has shown growth in 2024, aligning with the trend in the power and energy sector. The anticipation of additional momentum stems from the government's increased emphasis on expanding renewable energy use in the Interim Budget 2024. As one of the leading private sector players, Tata Power boasts a substantial clean energy portfolio of 5,500 MW, covering solar, wind and hydropower. Indian Hotels sustained strong performance across key metrics, driven by robust demand. The optimistic future outlook from management is encouraging, leading analysts to anticipate a robust earnings trajectory in the coming years, supported by various growth factors.

Smart (connected) cars and EVs have made private vehicles more software-driven now than they were before. A smart vehicle is usually connected via a SIM and functions like a smartphone on wheels. And like a smartphone, it can see, hear, and track the user. Data optimisation helps users with several things like route planning and cautioning about disruptions ahead. But it also allows car manufacturers to accumulate tonnes of personal information, giving rise to privacy concerns. And that has got consumers and the government thinking. The new Data Protection Act is expected to make it mandatory for companies to get informed consent from users on personal data sharing and storing. And if car manufacturers can voluntarily incorporate an informed approach to user data now, they could have a competitive edge, especially with the new generation of younger car owners. If your car or scooter has an internet connection and smart features like real-time location sharing and tracking, can connect with other devices like your smartphone and download software updates, it is probably collecting several data points. How this data is used, for how long it is stored, and who it is shared with, is still somewhat ambiguous. While some usersThe Core spoke to were not fully aware of their data being tracked until they were asked about it, all users said the ambiguity was a cause for concern. The new Digital Personal Data Protection Act, passed last year, is set to change this  making the law much more consumer-oriented, but its rules havent been notified yet. One first needs to understand what data points are being collected by these vehicles. My understanding is that it's primarily on three levels, Arundhati Kale, a lawyer and policy associate with CyberPeace Foundation explains. First is your telematics  which looks at your driving pattern, your acceleration, speeding, and how many times you break, among other things. Second is your geospatial mapping, looking at your location and which routes you take. And the third would be your battery-related data in the case of EVs. The company also has access to your data  like your name, address, phone number, email address, IP address, location data, and information about your device as soon as you interact with it, even on its website. One may ask  so whats the harm? Companies do use a lot of this data, like your driving pattern, telematics, and location access, for instance, to better your user experience. Ather Energy, way back in 2019,said they were using real-time data from sensors to map out a complete road profile and analyse driving patterns to display visual alerts of the road ahead. This would alert drivers of, say, potholes ahead. And the usersThe Core spoke to said this was something they preferred. Bazid Ashraf, who works in Chennai, said his big joint family in Kerala owns several connected cars and EVs. The elders sometimes go and check the speed or the location when my cousins or I have used the car, to keep an eye on it. Its helpful  tomorrow if I get into an accident in the middle of nowhere, its going to send an alert, another user said. It helps the company as well. A connected vehicle manufacturer will use this data in their research and development to understand how users are driving, and what areas need tweaking for example. Or if I need to deliver better customer service to my customers, advise them on how to use the vehicle better, how to improve longevity, etc, I can use the data points regarding how that customer is driving the vehicle, Kazim Rizvi, founding director of research and public policy think-tank The Dialogue, said. But theres a flip side to this. For one, there is still a lot of ambiguity about where the data is being used or how long it is being stored. It could be shared with third parties, for instance. User data is a prized commodity. What happens is, if you're not aware of how valuable your privacy is, there is always a challenge that some entities could collect and sell it to third parties, Rizvi said. A review of the privacy policies of some of the leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) shows that the language is still very ambiguous. For example, under the section on how long it stores your personal information, Tata Motors (EV) policy states, We retain personal data/information for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes. Some cars have a feature that tracks routes being driven, and offers route optimisation, helping you reach your destination quicker. If it is my own data, it is great. But let's say if my data is known to youthen you can over some time, tell me what route I will take, where's my home base, my office, how much time I spend, in each of these locations, who my friends areSo it creates a lot of privacy concerns, Praveen Sasidharan, partner, cyber emerging technology at accounting firm Deloitte, said. A global review of 25 car brands by Mozilla Foundation gave cars that they reviewed titles like Worst Product Category for privacy. Out of these, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and Toyota  leading brands in India  scored a super creepy in the Mozilla guide, for collecting data including sexual activity, genetic information, and geolocation and sharing it with marketing companies or law enforcement agencies. As many as 19 of the 25 car brands reviewed also stated that they sell users personal data. There is also the risk of cybersecurity  someone hacking into your vehicle, for example, and accessing your information or even controlling some of its functions. There have been several documented instances of Teslas being hacked by researchers or ethical hackers. Researchers haveshowcased vulnerabilities that would allow hackers to turn off lights, honk the horn, open the trunk, activate windshield wipers, and more. Charging grids are also vulnerable. In 2022, Russian public chargers were hacked to display pro-Ukraine messages. Software-driven vehicles also function on millions of lines of code for everything from deploying airbags to blind spot assistance or lane keep assistance and driver attention systems. Let's say this fails. It could cause chaos  injuries and death to the passengers and also to the pedestrians, Sasidharan pointed out. A survey by Deloitte in 2020 showed that nearly 70% of Indians were concerned about data privacy in connected vehicles. A more recent survey by LocalCircles revealed that 62% of Indian car buyers consider data privacy as a significant factor in their purchase decisions. Users thatThe Core spoke to complained about the lack of transparency and choice. My thought goes, what can I do? I don't have a choice, Pune-based Mihir Khot, who owns an Ola Electric scooter, and a Tata Tigor EV, said. You can either sign the privacy policy and purchase the vehicle or refrain from it completely. H* added that while he could deny permission at some points on his smartphone app, it started working slower. S* (did not wish to be named), an entrepreneur based in Odisha, recently signed up to buy Tata Motors latest launch - the Punch EV. His decision to purchase the car, was in part, driven by the fact that it doesnt come with an e-sim. But it wasn't a significant factor. ""On a scale of 1 to 10, I would have a 2 or 3 for privacy in a car,"" he said. The one thing that is an issue to me is that  what are you doing with that data? Are you selling it to third-party vendors? H* said. There is ambiguity in this as well. Tatas EV privacy policy, for instance, states that we do not sell or rent your personal details to third parties for marketing purposes. However, for data aggregation purposes we may use your personal data, which may be sold to other parties at our discretion. Privacy policies we reviewed had options for revoking consent for sharing personal data with such third-party service providers by writing to the company. TVS Motors policy for iQube, however, adds the caveat  you acknowledge that on exercising such an option, we may not be able to provide you with services associated with such personal information. When asked whether they had tried these methods, users toldThe Core that they would find it too complicated to go about this. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 is expected to change the way companies collect, process, and use data when it comes to building, driving, and expanding business models, Rizvi said. It would put the onus on the companies to get informed consent from users. A company has to clearly state what data it is storing, where and for how long, and what purpose it will be used for. This needs to be done in clear language, so users can understand, and be available in all official languages used in India, not just in English. While the rules are yet to be notified, OEMs have already started making changes, Sasidharan said. Once rules are notified, there would be clarity and a clear timeline on when the companies would have to incorporate the new guidelines. Certain companies are already updating privacy policies to make them more comprehensive, and using language that is easy to understand for users. Ola Electrics policy page now states, This policy is updated continuously to reflect the measures taken by us in relation to your personal data. There are also measures in the pipeline for safety and security as well. The Automotive Industry Standards (AIS) in India  AIS 189 and AIS 190  which are currently in the draft stage, will specify a framework for manufacturers to include cybersecurity management in their vehicles. We are hoping that it will be a law by the third quarter of this year, Sasidharan said. However, there is no official news on that yet. However, he said that it is likely that OEMs might get 2027 as the deadline to implement these. While the timeline for both laws is still unclear and may take a while, companies incorporating these right now will get a competitive edge. Younger generations are very keen to know about how their data is being usedSo definitely, this is a selling point, Sasidharan said. He said that companies should advertise the fact that they are offering better security. So this is now no longer a hygiene factorI would definitely encourage OEMs to go ahead and advertise as part of their selling strategy or marketing strategy, he added.  Data optimisation helps users but also allows car manufacturers to accumulate tonnes of personal information, giving rise to privacy concerns.",

Nearly 55% of those who voted approved a proposal to raise the base price to 18 an hour in the city center, triple the cost for smaller vehicles. The format of the referendum was similar to one held last year banning shared electric scooters. The citys authorities went through with the removal, even though few people turned out to vote. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has made the French capital a leader in urban climate-protection and anti-pollution health measures. Aside from significantly curtailing space taken up by cars  often frustrating drivers  shes set out to make Paris a 15-minute city where people can reach most daily necessities by foot or bicycle in that time. The parking measure would apply to vehicles weighing more than 1.6 tons, or 2 tons if theyre electric. While often derided for their size and higher levels of pollution, SUVs havent lost any of their appeal, including in France. SUV sales have risen sevenfold in the past decade in the country, representing about 40% of new car sales, according to a report by WWF France. In its proposal, the mayors office said SUVs take up too much space on streets and sidewalks in Paris and are more dangerous than smaller cars for pedestrians. Still, the referendum has come under fire for unfairly targeting families from the outskirts of the city that cant rely on public transport. Authorities in other cities, such as Frances Lyon and Tbingen in Germany, have already started to incorporate vehicle weight into car parking tariffs.

Data submitted by Apple with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) showed that Apple tested its autonomous car more than ever last year, reports Wired. Apple has a permit to test autonomous vehicle tech on Californias public roads only if the company has a safety driver behind the wheel. Apples secret car project is finally gaining momentum. Earlier reports claimed that Apple downgraded its ambitions to build a self-driving electric car. However, new documents show that the company is still testing its own self-driving car. Meanwhile, Googles Waymo drove 3.7 million testing miles in California with a safety driver behind the wheel and 1.2 million testing miles with no one behind the wheel. The company drove more than 1.6 million additional miles with passengers in the car, according to separate government documents, said the report. There were reports that Apple postponed the 2026 launch of the ""Apple Car,"" an electric vehicle that will purportedly cost less than $100,000. The company is still working on the vehicles design. Apple Car was first reported to arrive in 2024. Apple has also filed several new patents in software and hardware related to riding comfort such as seats and suspension. The iPhone maker is also reportedly working on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology, which allows cars to communicate with each other and connect to the Internet of Things (IoT).

The interim budget for FY25 has allocated Rs 3,500 crore towards a production-linked incentive for automobiles and auto components, according to documents released by the Finance Ministry on Thursday. In FY24, the outlay stood revised to a mere Rs 484 crore. The Union Cabinet had in September 2021 approved the auto PLI scheme with a budgetary outlay of Rs 25,938 crore for five yearsfrom FY23 to FY27. The scheme offers financial incentives for localisation of battery electric vehicles and attracting investments in the manufacturing value chain. The scheme is divided into two parts: The Champion OEM Incentive Scheme, linked to sales, is applicable for makers of battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles across segments. Eighteen companies, including Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Tata Motors Ltd., Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. and Hero MotoCorp. Ltd. have received approvals under the scheme. The Component Champion Incentive Scheme is for local manufacturing of hi-tech and high-value components by Indian auto components makers. Bosch Ltd., Bharat Forge Ltd., Minda Corp., Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd. and Pricol Ltd. are among the beneficiaries. So far, the approved applicants have proposed investments worth a total of Rs 74,850 crore. Separately, the central government has also allocated Rs 2,671.33 crore towards the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles, or FAME Scheme, for subsidy on electric vehicles. Thats down from Rs 4,807.40 crore in FY24 and Rs 2,402.51 crore in FY23. To be sure, this isn't the third iteration of the subsidy scheme, which original equipment manufacturers, particularly electric two-wheeler makers, are pushing for. ""The FAME subsidy hasnt been cut. Pending liabilities that are accruing will be settled,"" Finance Secretary TV Somanathan told NDTV Profit during an exclusive chat after presentation of the interim budget. The government had first rolled out the FAME subsidy scheme in 2015, in an attempt to push the adoption of electric vehicles in India. A second phase was implemented in 2019 for three years, but extended till March 2024 to account for the disruptions caused by the pandemic. While FAME-I had a budgetary outlay of Rs 895 crore, FAME-II has a much bigger allocation at Rs 10,000 crore. ""Our government will expand and strengthen the EV ecosystem by supporting manufacturing and charging infrastructure,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech, without mentioning any of the schemes. A PLI scheme for battery manufacturing, with an outlay of Rs 250 crore in FY25, was also announced in the interim budget.",

Tesla erases $80-bn investor wealth as Musk warns of slowing sales,"Shares of Tesla fell over 12% on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk warned sales growth would slow this year despite price cuts that have already affected profits at the EV-maker. The stock slump wiped over $80-billion investor wealth, pushing its market capitalisation loss for January to about $210 billion. This was Tesla's sharpest intraday percentage loss in over a year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/tesla-erases-80-billion-in-valuation-after-elon-musks-sales-warning-12128001.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Tesla tumbled over 12% on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk warned sales growth would slow this year despite price cuts that have already hurt margins at the world's most valuable automaker and fueled investor concerns about soft demand and Chinese competition. Musk said on Wednesday that growth would be ""notably lower"" as Tesla focuses on a cheaper, next-generation electric vehicle to be made at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, which is expected to spark the next boom in deliveries. But he said ramping up production of the new model would be challenging because it would involve cutting-edge technologies. Tesla's stock suffered its sharpest intraday percentage loss in more than a year, with $80 billion in market value wiped out on Thursday. That pushed its market capitalization loss for the month to about $210 billion. ""The Tesla headlines have essentially gone from bad to worse,"" said TD Cowen analysts, noting that the fourth-quarter revenue and profit were also below expectations. Shares of other EV makers also fell, with Rivian Automotive Inc, Lucid Group and Fisker down between 4.7% and 8.8%. The EV industry has been grappling with a slowdown in demand for more than a year and the price cuts by Tesla will likely worsen the pressure on the startups and automakers such as Ford. ""The problem for Tesla is any significant attempt to boost sales from here on will probably need to be achieved at the cost of further falls in operating margin, due to having to compete with BYD in China, as well as increased competition elsewhere,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. At least nine brokerages downgraded the stock, while seven raised their ratings. The company, on average, has a ""hold"" rating with a median price target of $225, 23% higher than the share's closing price of $182.63 on Thursday. Tesla short sellers have made $3.45 billion so far this year, making it the most profitable U.S. short trade, according to data and analytics firm Ortex. The company's stock trades at nearly 60 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, according to LSEG data. That gives it a more premium valuation than the other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks a group that includes Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Some analysts said valuation could become tough to justify if Tesla's sales growth and margin weaken further. ""Tesla is increasingly looking like a traditional auto company,"" said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.",
"No abuse of dominance: CCI on rejecting plea against Ola, 3 others","The Competition Commission of India has dismissed a plea that accused four two-wheeler EV makers of abusing their dominant position in the market. The plea claimed Ola Electric, Ather, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor were misusing the FAME subsidy to under-price vehicles and restrict small automakers. ""None of the market players appear to have a stable market share,"" CCI noted.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal/cci-junks-abuse-of-dominance-plea-against-ola-electric-hero-tvs-and-ather-12124461.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) recently dismissed a plea against electric two-wheeler (ETW) manufacturers Ola Electric, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Ather that alleged they were abusing their dominant position in the market. An anonymous person filed a plea before the anti-trust regulator alleging that these ETWs were abusing the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric & Hybrid Vehicles Policy (FAME) subsidy provided by the government to lower the cost of their vehicles. It was further alleged that this act of abuse allows them to sell their vehicles at a lower price thereby denying market access to smaller manufacturers. What was the case? The Government launched the FAME policy in 2015 to promote the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in India, with the goal of reducing the countrys dependence on fossil fuels, reducing air pollution and mitigating the impact of climate change. Each FAME policy has an end date, for instance FAME ended in 2019, FAME 1 ended in 2022. At present, the FAME II policy is in place and is expected to end in March 2024. The policy provides incentives to manufacturers and buyers of electric and hybrid vehicles with the aim to increase demand for these Electric Vehicles (EVs) /Hybrid vehicles by making them more affordable and accessible. The policy provided for a subsidy of Rs 10,000/- per KWh for all vehicles except buses which was subsequently enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- KWh. One eligibility criterion for availing of the demand incentive under the FAME scheme is that the maximum ex-factory price of a two-wheeler is to be Rs 1.5 lakh per vehicle. It was alleged that these ETW manufacturers are abusing the limit set by the government by selling integral equipment such as chargers and proprietary software/ upgrades at an additional cost over and above the Rs. 1.5 lakh limit. For instance, while the vehicle itself is priced at Rs. 1.5 lakh, these upgrades are charged as additions to the vehicle. However, if these charges are added to the cost of the vehicle, these companies may not be able to avail the subsidy. The complainant alleged that these actions deprived genuine manufacturers from availing of the benefit of the budget allocated for EVs under the Rs. 1.5 lakh threshold. Furthermore, the complainant stated that this action resulted in an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market for the market participants and the consumers. Furthermore, the complainant said, the ETW manufacturers abused their dominant position in the market in violation of various provisions of the competition law. These practices denied market access, to small manufacturers as they would not be able to take the benefit of the FAME policy and as a result find it difficult to establish themselves in this highly competitive market. What was CCIs order? In its order, the CCI noted that as per publicly available information on the two-wheeler market, Hero Electric and Okinawa have a market share of 28.23 percent and 20.08 percent respectively, followed by Ampere with a 10.65 percent market share, whereas Ather, Ola and TVS have a share of 8.63 percent, 6.21 percent and 4.09 percent respectively. The order said, Thus, the Commission notes that none of the market players appear to have a stable market share or position. According to CCI, the electric vehicles market is in a growth stage with players coming up with different ranges of vehicles, and hence the competition is expected to intensify as more players fight for market share. Thus the CCI concluded that there is no dominant player in the market able to exert market power in its favour or appear to demonstrate a position of strength to operate independently of market forces. Since there is no dominant player in the market, there is no case for abuse of dominant position.",
Tesla may skip 1st Bharat Mobility Global Expo: Report,"Tesla might skip the first edition of the upcoming Bharat Mobility Global Expo, Moneycontrol reported.

However, the Elon Musk-owned Tesla Inc may give this mega exhibition a miss, sources told Moneycontrol. So far, Tesla has not indicated its participation in the expo. However, we have many other major EV manufacturers participating, one of the sources said. Bharat Mobility Global Expo The Bharat Mobility Global Expo is being organised for the first time this year. It is expected to see participation from over 600 exhibitors from more than 50 countries, including specialised exhibitions on EVs. Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2024 is being organized bymultiple industry bodies under the overall guidance of the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India is scheduledfrom 1- 3 February 2024 at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. The event will cover the entire value chain of the mobility industry including automobiles, automotive components, supply chain, equipment & components, energy storage solutions, battery recycling, urban mobility, and alternative fuels together at a single venue. The Auto Expo is currently Indias largest automobile exhibition, which is held every two years. Discussions are underway to make the Bharat Mobility Global Expo an annual event and a possible merge with the biennial auto expo, the second source cited added. The expo could see a large participation from major international and Indian battery manufacturers and battery supply chain and recycling companies. More than 10 leading companies will also be showcasing their EV infrastructure services, including charging stations and battery-swapping solutions, the government said in a release on January 5. Around 30 domestic and international OEMs (original equipment makers) are also expected, another source said. Teslas absence Teslas absence in a mega event focusing on mobility is telling, given that the US-based electric car maker has been looking to enter India for over two years now. Tesla executives have held meetings with Indian government officials at least three times during 2023 as the company is reportedly considering setting up a factory in India to manufacture a $24,000 car. During his maiden state visit to the US in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in New York. That time, Modi had asked Musk to consider India as a potential manufacturing base. In fact, as recently as last month, media reports were suggesting that the prominent electric car maker may announce plans to set up a plant in India in January during the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in the presence of Musk. However, neither Musk nor executives from Tesla were present in the Summit. Reports also suggested that the Indian government is looking to lower import duty on EVs, a move seen as a response to a request from Tesla. The US-based EV maker had first tried to enter India in 2021 by pushing officials to lower the 100 percent import tax. However, India has been reluctant to lower import duties on EVs, given that it could put domestic manufacturers at a disadvantage. Moneycontrol had reported on December 18 that the Indian government is more open to granting duty concessions on EVs through the free trade agreement (FTA) route with specific nations over lowering import duty for the sector as a whole, a development that is expected to delay Teslas India entry.  EV presence The expo could also see the return of EV maker Great Wall Motors to India, a China-based privately owned automobile manufacturer, which is the eighth largest in Beijing. American car manufacturer Ford, which had paused its sales and business about two years ago, is also likely to announce a comeback to the Indian market at the mega exhibition next month, the second source said. Media reports recently suggested that after exiting the country in 2021, Ford is planning to bring back its popular SUVs to India. The presence of key EV makers in the mega exhibition is crucial for India, given the countrys push to incentivise cleaner mobility. The Indian government has already taken steps to push for the adoption of EVs. Apart from the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the automobile and auto component industry, with a budgetary outlay of Rs 25,938 crore, to provide financial incentives to boost domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technologies products, including EVs and their components, it has also reduced the goods and services tax (GST) on these vehicles to 5 percent from 12 percent.",2024-02-03

The price adjustment, set to take effect from February 1, 2024, is a strategic move by the company to mitigate the impact of rising input costs. While the specific percentage increase for individual models remains undisclosed, Tata Motors has communicated a weighted average rise of 0.7 per cent. The extent of the hike will vary depending on the particular variant and model. Consequently, popular models like the Tiago, Nexon, Harrier, and Safari are expected to experience a surge in their price tags. Even the recently launched Punch EV, which initially entered the market with an introductory price tag of Rs 11 lakh, ex-showroom, is anticipated to be impacted by the price adjustment. With a significant market share in India, Tata Motors currently sells a diverse range of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. The company has also established a strong presence in the electric vehicle market, particularly with its segment-leading model, the Nexon EV. The manufacturer recently unveiled updates to its Nexon range, along with its Safari and Harrier SUVs, indicating a commitment to enhancing its product offerings. This decision to raise prices follows a similar move by Tata Motors in April 2023 when it increased prices for its passenger vehicle range by approximately 0.6 per cent, effective from May 1st. Despite these previous adjustments, the company has achieved an impressive 9 per cent growth in overall passenger vehicle sales, including electric vehicles, in the domestic market. December 2023 recorded sales reaching 43,470 units, reflecting a notable increase from 40,043 units in December 2022.

With India's EV market comprising only 2 per cent of car sales last year, JSW Group's ambitious plan aims to tap into the growing sector. Tata Motors currently dominates the market, but the government's target of achieving a 30 per cent share by 2023 has spurred JSW Group's entry. In the first two phases of the investment, JSW Group plans to allocate 250 billion rupees for the establishment of an EV battery manufacturing plant and an EV components plant. The conglomerate's commitment to the EV space extends to a joint venture formed in November with China's SAIC Motor, emphasising green mobility and overall development of the electric vehicle ecosystem. The third phase of the plan involves an additional investment of 150 billion rupees to set up an EV components manufacturing complex. Meanwhile, India is deliberating a proposed policy that would decide whether to reduce import taxes on EVs, potentially facilitating Tesla's entry into the market. Key players like Tata, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Hyundai Motor are advocating to maintain the current policy, discouraging tax reductions on hybrids. As JSW Group accelerates its EV investments, the landscape of India's electric vehicle market is poised for significant transformation.

"E-Scooter explodes, consumer court orders Rs 10 Lakh compensation","Telangana consumer court ordered Chinese EV maker Benling India and dealer to jointly compensate Rs 10 lakh to a consumer whose electric scooter faced battery explosion and fire last February, destroying the vehicle. Benling failed to investigate the incident or respond to commission notices, demonstrating disregard for consumer safety according to ruling which strengthens EV user protection.",https://trak.in/stories/consumer-court-orders-rs-10-lakh-compensation-for-electric-scooter-owner-manufacturer-refuses-to-help-in-investigation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Saturday, July 6, 2024 Mohul Ghosh Jan 20, 2024 A District Consumer Commission in Telangana has ordered Chinese electric vehicle maker Benling India and a dealer to jointly pay 10 lakh as compensation to a consumer after an e-scooter fire incident due to battery explosion. Benling Scooter Catches Fire In the case from February 2023, a Benling Aura e-scooter purchased by complainant in April 2021 met with a battery explosion and caught fire, destroying the vehicle completely. The incident spotlights the lingering safety issues around Li-ion batteries in EVs. The consumer approached both manufacturer Benling India and the dealer, seeking a replacement vehicle or refund of original cost along with 18% annual interest. As he did not receive any response, he then filed a formal complaint claiming 13.5 lakh reparations. Manufacturer Untraceable Despite legal notices by Medak District Consumer Commission, neither Benling India nor dealer appeared for hearings or offered any explanation regarding battery explosion investigation. The commission emphasized that it is the automakers responsibility to probe and address such battery defects pointing to critical safety lapses. In light of the apathy displayed and harm caused to consumer, the judges ordered the manufacturer and dealer to jointly pay compensation of 10 lakh including litigation costs within 30 days failing which 9% additional penalty would apply. The ruling has been hailed for strengthening protection and grievance redressal avenues available for EV owners in India. It sends a stern warning for manufacturers to proactively investigate and mitigate technical risks, unlike Benlings evasive approach that endangered consumer safety in this case. More consumer courts standing up for victims and holding automakers accountable also raises hope for transparency and due diligence by EV industry to win trust.

These new batteries from MIT may soon be on future Lamborghini EV,"Lamborghini has partnered with MIT to license a new battery technology called TAQ, seeking an alternative to the popular Lithium-ion batteries. This TAQ battery offers higher capacity and fast-charging features, potentially enhancing power and efficiency in Lamborghini's future vehicles.",https://www.news9live.com/auto/mit-taq-battery-lamborghini-ev-2414433/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Top Highlights: In a significant development for the electric vehicle (EV) industry, Lamborghini has entered into a licensing agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for an innovative battery technology known as TAQ. This collaboration marks a pivotal shift from traditional Lithium-ion (Li-on) batteries to a more advanced and sustainable option. The TAQ battery, a brainchild of researchers at MIT, including an Indian-origin scientist, is a high-capacity power cell that surpasses the capabilities of conventional Li-on batteries. Notably, it boasts fast-charging features and is composed of organic materials, offering an eco-friendly solution to the automotive sector. This organic battery, crafted from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, is arranged in a unique hexagonal structure. Its composition not only makes it environmentally sound but also ensures 50% better energy density compared to the Li-on NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) chemistry. This development comes at a crucial time when the automotive world is actively seeking alternatives to Li-on batteries due to their costly and environmentally harmful mining processes. The partnership between Lamborghini and MIT was birthed from a project initiated about six years ago in Dincs lab at MIT. Funded by Lamborghini, the goal was to develop an organic battery suitable for powering electric cars. The discovery of TAQ as a robust organic conductor was a breakthrough in this endeavor. The integration of TAQ technology into Lamborghinis future EVs is expected to significantly enhance their performance, efficiency, and environmental footprint. This move also aligns with the broader industry trend of transitioning to more sustainable and economically viable battery technologies, like sodium-ion batteries.",
"Telangana in active talks with China's BYD, Musk's Tesla: CM Reddy","Speaking to a select audience at the Indian High Commission in London, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said the state is in active communication with Elon Musk's Tesla and Chinese automaker BYD. Notably, Indian government rejected BYD's offer to set up $1-billion manufacturing plant in July, and Tesla is reportedly in talks to set up its first plant in India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/are-tesla-byd-coming-to-hyderabad-what-telangana-cm-revanth-reddy-said-in-london-12096741.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy told a select audience at the Indian High Commission in London that the state is in active communication with Tesla and BYD. In his first foreign tour since winning the elections and becoming the Chief Minister in December 2023, Reddys brief and quick reference to Tesla and BYD piqued the interest of all those who were present. Interestingly, in July 2023, New Delhi had denied permission to BYD, a Chinese firm, to set up a manufacturing unit in Hyderabad. Tesla has been looking to enter India for over two years, and Telanganas former Industry and Commerce minister KT Rama Rao had famously written to its CEO Elon Musk on social media inviting him to the state. On Thursday evening, clad in a white shirt and jeans, Reddy, unlike most politicians, chose to make a rather small speech, during which he hinted two of the worlds biggest electric vehicle manufacturers could come to Hyderabad. The 54-year-old Reddy, who was previously in the Telugu Desam Party before joining Congress in 2017, did not elaborate on what stage or how imminent a deal with the two major EV manufacturers. It is well-known that Hyderabad is one of the most sought after destinations for foreign multinationals looking to set up a base in India. Accompanied by a small team of bureaucrats, Reddy, who came to the UK from Davos where he attended the World Economic Forum, proclaimed Telangana means business. The 54-year-old Reddy highlighted pharma, medical device, IT, aerospace, data science as some of the sectors where Telangana had made spectacular progress and continues to attract investments. Reddy announced that the state will concentrate on developing medical tourism and will bring a new energy policy. Hyderabad has the potential to emerge as a major destination for medical tourism especially for countries where there are long waiting periods for surgeries like the UK. The large majority of medical tourists to India come from Southeast Asia, Africa, and Middle East, but cost advantage and quick treatment has the potential to further increase the numbers from Europe and America. Reddy also spelt out the vision to develop Telangana as a leading hub for Artificial Intelligence and healthcare.  The newly sworn-in Telangana Chief Minister Sri Revanth Reddy addressed a group of Indophile British Members of Parliament in the Westminster Building, London, the UK, on Thursday. (Photo via Facebook) One key reason for Reddys visit to London was to study and understand the maintenance of the Thames river in order to revive and rejuvenate Musi river in Hyderabad. We want to make a new city around Musi river. As it runs around 55 km in Hyderabad this will be one of its kind project, he said. Amrapali Kata, IAS, and managing director of the Musi River Development Corporation Limited (MRDCL) said, they had several meetings with officials from Port of London Authority to understand how the maintenance of river Thames evolved over the years. Just hours before Reddy spoke at the Indian High Commission, he took part in a meeting in Westminster where Parliamentarians, business leaders and members of the diaspora were present. I was the MP from one of the biggest Parliamentary constituencies in India. I resigned, but it was a happy story as I ultimately formed the government in Telangana. Among those present were Lord Rami Ranger, MPs Paul Scully, Valerie Vaz, and Virendra Sharma, who was the host. Democracy is one feature which is common to both India and the UK. We have a duty to make democracy stronger. My party fought for Indias independence and Mahatma Gandhi showed the world that we can fight for freedom and democracy with love and non-violence. A local councillor, originally from Telangana, asked Reddy whether his government could do something about coming to the aid of Indian students (from Telangana) facing violence, or family members struggling to repatriate the bodies of their loved ones to India. Reddy assured the lady councillor that they will consider establishing a helpline or separate cell for the UK, just like they had for those from Telangana who were employed in Gulf countries.  (From left) Martyn Day, Revanth Reddy and Virendra Sharma at Westminster, London, the UK. (Photo: Danish Khan) My government stands for welfare and development. I was in opposition for 20 years and I want to win trust every day, and not just during the election period. He told the assembled MPs that his government will roll out several women centric policies  providing Scootys to girl students to facilitate travel, free travel on buses for women, and financial reimbursement schemes for girls. And although he mentioned his visit to Davos where he bagged investments from Adani Group, Godrej Industries, JSW Energy, among others, he reminded the audience that he was the son of a farmer and got the opportunity to become the chief minister despite coming from a marginalised background. Over 70 per cent of our population depends on agriculture, farmers are very important. Agriculture is the culture of India.",

This is still at a negotiation stage. And during the course of sensitive negotiations like this, we really can't get ahead of ourselves and start talking about what the final formula will be. As I always say about this issue, whatever incentive mechanisms are put in place by the government will be applicable for all players and not only for any particular company, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Indian automakers Mahindra and Tata Motors have asked the Indian officials not to lower import taxes of 100 percent on electric vehicles and protect domestic firms as the government reviews Tesla's plans to enter the market, Reuters reported last month. Tesla has reportedly proposed setting up an Indian factory but also demanded lower import taxes for electric cars. With artificial intelligence being the focus of discussions at Davos this year, the DPIIT Secretary said that India's digital public infrastructure enables it to leverage huge volumes of data to train language models and create good use cases for the country. We hope that this is going to happen. The indication I have is that the Indian industry's willingness to adopt AI is perhaps one of the foremost in the world. We certainly expect the trend towards AI to be a net positive for the Indian economy and for the manufacturing sector in particular, he said. With DPIIT being the nodal agency for the governments Startup India programme, Singh also said that India is making efforts to ensure that young companies dont have to flip their corporate headquarters to foreign locations to raise funding. Some kind of reverse flipping is beginning to happen. Offshoring of some of our financial transactions through GIFT City is going to help startups to stay in India and raise funds. In addition, in the future, you will have more relaxed listing norms for companies, he said. And as a result, many of these startups in general with a promising revenue stream and a promising idea should be able to raise funds through IPOs as well in the not too distant future, he added.",

This made people curiously want to know his net worth and details about the luxurious cars he owns. Here's everything you need to know about the businessman who heads the world's largest company producing suiting fabric.  From his lavish lifestyle to the controversies he drove into, take a look at the ups and downs while taking a glimpse at the life of the industrialist.  Gautam Singhania's Lifestyle  Gautam Singhania's expensive possessions will remind you of the popular Bollywood dialogue: ""Aaj mere paas paisa hai, bangla hai, gaadi hai..."" His reported net worth runs more than a billion US dollars and includes a 1000 crore yacht, a teak boat that famous actress Liz Hurley allegedly partied on, a lavish residence with a helipad, an exclusive museum, and five-level parking cars to host his flashy car collection, two privately-owned helicopters.  The businessman's personal jet called a ""Bombardier Challenger 600"" is said to be valued at Rs 150 crore. Notably, he happens to be one of India's wealthiest persons alive and has the second tallest home in India next to Mukesh Ambani's Antilia.  Apart from enjoying water sports, his Instagram posts show him as an adventure lover firing the AK47 machine gun during a visit to Russia. Of course, he is also often seen gearing up on racing tracks, participating at vintage car show, and more to live his life in the coolest way possible.  Gautam Singhania Controversies  Singhania has been involved in several controversies and legal disputes during his business years including the divorce-assault case concerning his estranged wife Nawaz Modi, the JK House Dispute, and the shareholding issue of Raymond.  In late 2023, the Singhania couple announced their separation after 32 years of marriage and the lady demanded 75% of his net worth in their divorce settlement, closely amounting to $1.4 billion 116.32 crore INR. The couple had dated for some years before getting into the wedding knot. However, the former partner accused Singhania of domestic abuse.  Raymond Group CMD's family villa at Mumbai's Breach Candy has been listed in several controversies. In 2016, BMC pointed out the 37-storey JK House of Coastal Regulation Zone violation. A few years before that, the body stalled the work at the site looking into its built-up area going beyond the sanctioned limits. Meanwhile, the space also drew eyeballs concerning the father-son duo claiming possession of the construction.  Recent reports alert investors about the pressure on Raymond's stock amidst the family feud which has fallen more than 5% since the businessman's divorce from his better half. Also, in 2017, the company encountered a huge mess resulting in a controversy for not informing their shareholders about the ambitious reconstruction of Raymond House in South Mumbai.

On Monday, the 47-year-old spoke to Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the third edition of Global Investment Meet (GIM) in Chennai. The two-day GIM that concluded on January 8, brought Rs 6.64 lakh crore in proposed investments along with 26.9 lakh prospective jobs in the state. This well surpasses the expected investment of 5 lakh crore. Rajaa said he hopes to see 70 percent of them being converted into actual investments as opposed to 15-25 percent under the previous AIADMK government. Son of former Union cabinet minister TR Baalu, Rajaa was sworn in as the Tamil Nadu Industries minister in May 2023 and GIM was the first major test of his administrative and organisational skills. Excerpts from the interview: Your government appears to have timed GIM ahead of the Vibrant Gujarat summit. There are reports that Tesla may invest in Gujarat If Tesla's Elon Musk is interested in manufacturing in a green, clean, and progressive state with upcoming policies ondiversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) policy, transgender, and LGBTQI inclusion, and a commitment to diversity in the workforce, Tamil Nadu is the answer. Our talent pool is diverse, and we are the most inclusive, equitable, and sustainable state. Investing in Tamil Nadu also allows businesses to tap into our talented workforce, ensuring a quick return on investment. With such a conducive environment, why would you want to go elsewhere? But its being said that Gujarat could be the frontrunner We are delighted as long as they (Tesla) invest in India. We welcome every major company to establish a presence in our country. If a company recognises the value here (Tamil Nadu) and believes there's potential, we extend an invitation. However, we are not in a desperate state; we judiciously utilise our incentives. We prioritise spending funds responsibly and are particularly keen on creating specific types of employment. We value relationships built on mutual respect with all industries, especially in manufacturing, where we proudly hold the title of the manufacturing capital of India, with 45,000 factories and many more in the pipeline. Also, read:TN GIM 2024: Tamil Nadu pulls all stops to woo investors ahead of Vibrant Gujarat meet How do you assess the response to the Global Investment Meet? The response has been beyond our expectations, with lakhs of crores of investments and jobs. Every hall was overflowing with diverse participants, including youngsters, college students, young entrepreneurs, new investors, and homegrown investors. This is the third edition of the GIM in the state. What has been the conversion rate of previous GIM editions? Earlier editions of GIM conducted by the previous AIADMK government were largely for publicity purposes. What were doing now is business. The conversion rate of those GIM promises/MoUs was only 15- 25 percent. So, I wish to see 70 percent of the investment promises of this GIM being converted into reality. Every company has its problems, and the market situation might change. Everybody will be happy with anything above a 50 percent conversion rate, but I'm looking at 70 percent. Im very bullish about that; I think well come close. What do you think are Tamil Nadus roadblocks/ weaknesses? We have always been a very reserved state. Its a weakness. We werent open about our strengths. But now things are changing, we have started to communicate more, and people are beginning to understand the true significance of Tamil Nadu. We are not just about culture, heritage or tourism. We take pride in being the manufacturing behemoth of India, driving the country's industrial power. Tamil Nadu plays a crucial role in powering India, yet this fact may not be widely known because it hasn't been marketed effectively. Experts cite the lack of social infrastructure in the cities of Tamil Nadu and argue that the states liquor policy is outdated. How would you respond? Contrary to perception, the social infrastructure in our region is fantastic, and we take great pride in our responsible and cosmopolitan community. It's not a place where people laze around; life here is very hectic. We have become the second-biggest economy through hard work, and there is still much more to accomplish. We are actively focusing on enhancing women's participation in the workforce, developing technical expertise, and investing in research and development. This progressive approach is at an advanced stage, and we believe that social infrastructure will naturally follow. Expect to see more progressive policies being implemented in the future.

We dont measure ourselves against other states; our comparisons are with Scandinavian countries. By abiding by global standards, we project to become the 45th largest economy worldwide. Our scale is on par with countries, not just states, and the numbers speak volumes. When you consider the workforce, 43 percent of all working women in India are from Tamil Nadu, a figure unmatched elsewhere. So, how do you plan to take this forward? This marks the start of a journey; it doesnt end today or tomorrow. Its just the beginning. Our next stop is Davos (World Economic Forum), where we will present a substantial pitch. Subsequently, we plan to expand our outreach to Europe and Australia.",

In 2023, the trend of premiumisation in personal vehicles continued and was further strengthened. It was also a year full of highs and lows. This year the Indian automobile industry also overcame long-standing supply chain shortages, especially in semiconductor chips, that plagued the industry in calendar year 2022. The industry posted impressive sales numbers, especially during the festive season, but demand for passenger vehicles slowed down. While two-wheelers saw robust growth, government subsidy cuts for electric two-wheelers affected growth. Both, in passenger vehicles and the two-wheelers segment, demand for premium variants eclipsed the entry-level segment  a clear sign of behavioural changes among users in the country. Consumers over the last few years have increasingly preferred feature-rich cars, and SUV sales hitrecord numbers in 2023. This is likely to continue, in keeping with a global trend, experts The Core spoke to pointed out. In the last two years, the number of SUV launches was more than all other passenger vehicle launches combined, with sedans and hatchbacks taking a hit. Similarly, the share of premium is growing across the two-wheeler segment. In 2023, both Hero Motocorp and Bajaj Auto Ltdlaunched locally-made Harley-Davidson and Triumph motorcycles respectively, a big challenge to the dominating Royal Enfield in the premium bikes segment. The rise of premium variants indicates a growing consumer preference for smarter features and the use of vehicles for leisure and adventure. As disposable incomes grow, this trend is expected to continue going forward. Electric vehicles (EVs) made the loudest buzz in 2023. The industry crossed a record 15 lakh sales in the calendar year 2023. As EVs are poised to further eat into the market share of both two-wheelers and cars, 2024 may be a defining year for electric two-wheelers. One, there is still uncertainty about whether or not the governments Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India (FAME-II) subsidy will be renewed after March 2024. Discontinuing the subsidy will affect the sales of electric two-wheelers and EV penetration which has made strides last year. Secondly, while crude oil prices globally have been dropping, 2024 is also an election year. Should the centre reduce duties on fuel, petrol, and diesel engines two-wheelers will swoop in. Meanwhile, the passenger vehicle growth outlook seems muted. We arent too bullish, Hemal Thakkar, senior practice leader and director at credit rating agency CRISIL toldThe Core. Two-wheelers will grow anywhere in the range of 5-7%...but passenger vehiclesif it witnesses a growth it will be in the range of 0-5%, he added. While supply issues eased for passenger vehicles, demand in the last year also slowed, Thakkar said. In 2023, stocking at dealerships increased substantially. As per our understanding, even post-festive stocks are at more than 40 days, which is normally not the case with respect to passenger vehicles, he said. In the coming year, challenges might arise with price hikes announced and not as many newer models lined up for launch. One of the key changes the industry is grappling with is consumer behaviour. Consumers are more and more preferring to buy premium variants rather than entry-level cars. Consumers are becoming more finicky about features, said Thakkar. A buyer visiting a dealership will look for a vehicle fitting their requirements, and if it doesnt fit their budget, they would rather wait or go to a second-hand dealership and get that model. This is clearly showing signs that the behaviour of people in the country is changing,Jeffry Jacob, partner and national sector leader, automotive, at KPMG India toldThe Core in an email. This trend is only expected to continue going forward as disposable incomes grow, he also said. Not only is the premium market witnessing more demand, but a key occurrence of 2023 was SUV sales overtaking sedan and hatchback sales for the first time. This follows a global trend, with SUVs, or utility vehicles, being preferred. The number of new launches of SUV models has been increasing, while for hatchbacks and sedans, it has been steadily decreasing, Jacob said. Plus, SUVs are being launched at lower price points as well. New safety regulations have been increasing the prices for entry-level hatchbacks, reducing the gap. So we can expect SUVs to continue their strong growth trend going forward, Jacob said. In 2023, the passenger vehicle segment saw heavy discounting at dealerships, especially in the festive season, which could be a sign that all may not be rosy. A lot of it is also going to depend on how the inventory scenario plays out in the quarter four of this financial year, Thakkar said. Two-wheeler sales this year improved significantly compared to last year. Following demand contraction in recent years, two-wheeler demand is returning to normalcy, though far from its peak sales levels of financial year 2019, Srikumar Krishnamurthy, senior vice president and co-group head - corporate ratings, ICRA Limited toldThe Core. The recent festive season saw strong growth in two-wheeler retails. The ongoing marriage season coupled with recovery in rural demand supported some growth in the entry-level segment (below 110 cc two-wheelers), Krishnamurthy said. However, the premium segment has seen the highest growth even in two-wheelers. In motorcycles for instance, the 200cc and above segment has seen phenomenal growth, while the 150cc and above segment still needs to come back to FY2019 levels. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have kind of understood that the customer is looking at premium 2-wheelers, and they are also getting those products to the market, Thakkar said. In 2023, leading bikemakers Hero Motocorp and Bajaj Auto Ltd launched the countrys first locally-made Harley-Davidson and Triumph motorcycles, a big challenge to the dominating Royal Enfield in the premium bikes segment. This just highlights how the share of premium vehicles is growing. Similarly on the scooter side, if you see the 120 cc and above segment, it is doing very good, but if you look at the 110 cc segment it is seeing a challenge, said Thakkar. As per ICRA estimates, the two-wheeler volume is expected to grow 4-7% year-on-year in FY2023 -24. However, despite the moderate growth, Krishnamurthy flagged concerns regarding rural demand (impacted by uneven rainfall). Scooters remain supported by urban-centric factors while for motorcycles, factors like elevated ownership costs, higher interest rates, and inflation remain headwinds, he said. However, the premium segment would continue to do well, experts said. Both passenger vehicles and two-wheelers that are petrol or diesel-run have seen increasing competition from electric vehicles this year. Penetration of electric two-wheelers rose from 2% of total scooter sales in the first quarter of FY2021-22 to 14-16% in FY2022-23, as per ICRA data. The electric two-wheeler industry faced a setback in June 2023, when the governments FAME-II subsidy was slashed, and there was a temporary setback. But the demand has picked up with November 2023 sales growing approximately 20% over October, and penetration at about 5%, Jacob said. However, FAME-II is set to expire in March 2024 and there is still a lot of uncertainty about whether the scheme will be extended as FAME-III or not. If not, the segment might be adversely impacted. One is because the upfront cost of the vehicle will go up significantly, and second because globally, crude oil prices are falling. And we are in a pre-election year if the government reduces duties on fuel then you will actually see that your normal ICE scooters will swing back in action, said Thakkar. While EV penetration seems to be continuing at a healthy pace, hybrid cars are being poised as the intermediate step  solving the range anxiety and offering better mileage, while also inducing user confidence. But how much more of them will we see in 2024? While there have been some strong models in the market, and more launches lined up, hybrids are expensive, Thakkar said. The goods and services tax (GST) on EVs is 5% while the GST on hybrids is 43%. However, going forward, if there is a rationalisation of taxes on the hybrid front, you may see the market picking up, said Thakkar. Plus, the share of passenger EVs is very low currently. If the share increases, the government will be forced to relook at the duty structure because otherwise they will have to face a GST loss, he added. While 2023 has been an eventful year for the automobile industry, with high and low points, policy changes and an upcoming election are set to make 2024 comparatively difficult.",

Patel was responding to queries based on news reports suggesting that the US-based electric vehicle maker was planning to set up a manufacturing plant in Gujarat. ""The state government is very hopeful of Tesla coming to Gujarat. Even Elon Musk is looking at Gujarat as his first choice. Gujarat is in his mind ever since he began a survey in India to find a suitable location to set up the plant,"" said Patel, who is health minister and spokesperson of the state government. ""Perhaps, very soon, an official announcement will be made in this regard (Tesla's entry. Let us hope Tesla comes to Gujarat. We will definitely welcome it and provide all necessary support, just like we gave Tata, Ford and Suzuki in the past,"" Patel told reporters in Gandhinagar. Patel said communication (with Tesla) was on and this may be the reason such news (of firm planning factory in the state) was published. Notably, Elon Musk, chief of the world's largest electric car producer Tesla Inc, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June in New York. Musk, after meeting the Prime Minister, had said he plans to visit India in 2024. In September, Gujarat's Additional Chief Secretary (Industries and Mines Department) S J Haider said the Centre is in touch with Tesla to consider setting up a manufacturing facility in India. He had said Gujarat will approach the company at an appropriate time to ensure the state has a significant role in the future plans. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal had recently said Tesla is looking to source components worth around $1.9 billion from India this year against $1 billion last year.",
The Enfield’s Music Connection,"Would you believe it if we told you that the Royal Enfield, one of the most loved and recognized motorcycle brands of the world, has a strange bond with Carnatic Music? To be more specific, with the Madras Music Academy in Royapettah, Chennai which is one of the earliest musical establishments in South India.",https://thepaperclip.in/the-enfields-music/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Would you believe it if we told you that the Royal Enfield, one of the worlds most loved and recognized motorcycle brands, has a strange bond with Carnatic Music? Let us take you on this intriguing ride. The Madras Music Academy in Royapettah, Chennai, is one of the earliest musical establishments in South India. Its library with a collection of over 6000 books is a treasure trove for music lovers. But more interestingly, it bears the name of an Industrialist. Known as the K R Sundaram Iyer Memorial Library, it pays tribute to a man who was equally in love with music and machines. To know this story, we have to go back almost 70 years when India had just become independent. In the early 1950s India was still nascent as an independent nation and was facing threats from all around its border. So it needed some serious hardware for its Army personnel. There was one particular request for motorcycles that could navigate the rugged terrain of Indias borders. So, an order was placed with Redditch for 800 units of the Royal Enfield 350cc motorcycles, also known as bullets. It was Royal Enfields Indian partners, Madras Motors who took up the order of delivering these gun-like machines to the Indian Army and it is here that the story gets interesting. Madras Motors was formed by K.R. Sundaram Iyer and his nephew K Eswaran Iyer who were from a small town in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. The uncle-nephew duo had by that time made a name for themselves by selling cycles. The duo had established Royal Cycles and the English Cycles and Motorcycles Importing Co on Broadway by then. The company for the most part sold branded bicycles from companies like Raleigh, Humber, BSA, and Hercules.  To boost their motorcycle business, the duo opened a retail outlet on Broadway called Madras Motors; they hoped to import foreign brands like Royal Enfield and Norton. And it was in 1952 that they bagged the contract for the Indian Army. To cater to the huge order and expecting a rising demand, Redditch and Madras Motors established a joint venture and their first factory was set up in Tiruvottiyur near Chennai. The machines were assembled at the new factory with parts coming in from the UK. Soon under Iyers leadership, the Enfield bullets established themselves as reliable mean machines, and orders started pouring in from all over the country. But Iyer was more than just a businessman. He had an equally good understanding of music. For many budding musicians who wanted to establish themselves in Carnatic music, Madras was still out of bounds. Iyer would often help these musicians; his house became a safe haven for them. He served as a treasurer of the Madras Music Academy and also as its fourth president overseeing many of its developments and its modern building. In the 70s, production of the Enfield bullets had completely shifted to its Indian unit and by then Iyers sons had also become involved in the business. It is said his younger son S. Vishwanathan took his fathers legacy to a whole new level. Not only was Enfield able to establish itself as the most sought-after big bike brand under Vishwanathans chairmanship, but much like his father, he was also a strong proponent of the arts and music. He established the Kala Mandir Trust, which helped organize functions and concerts promoting young musical talents. He created a system for recruiting musicians and providing them with a stipend. Many well-established musicians now were beneficiaries of his schemes. As a mark of tribute on Vishwanathans 75th birth anniversary on November 10, 2010, the Kaa Mandir Trust organized a cultural programme, dedicating a music album to him. So, next time when you hear the Bullets thuk thuk sound, you might want to search for a hint of Carnatic music in it.

The Chinese tech giant has a tailored method of welcoming the new dawn with an announcement of its unprecedented venture into electric car manufacturing. It has been an exceptional odyssey for the brand since its initial announcement about delving into the EV business. To make the final days of this year exceptionally distinctive, the Chinese mobile maker has now officially unveiled an end-of-year event solely destined to discuss various aspects of its upcoming electric vehicles. Xiaomis CEO, Lei Jun, used X (previously known as Twitter) on Christmas Day to unearth the Xiaomi EV Technology launch event. Welcome aboard, Xiaomi SU7! pic.twitter.com/bpJJmC8EB8 The event is to be held on December 28 at 2:00 PM Beijing Time (11:30 AM IST). Moreover, the digital stream of the launch event will be showcased on Xiaomis official YouTube channel. It is worth mentioning that the event will not include any introduction of new products; rather, it will delve into technology and how it might work if the brand puts it into action. Its worth noting that Xiaomi has unveiled its first-ever electric vehicle, the SU7, in China. The SU7, an electric sedan, is presented in two versions: one potentially equipped with Lidar and the other without, as per HT Autos report. Buyers can select between two powertrain options: Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) and All-Wheel Drive (AWD). The electric sedan will be offered in three distinct models upon its launch: SU7, SU7 Pro, and SU7 Max. In the RWD model, a single electric motor will be positioned on the rear axle, generating 295 bhp. On the other hand, the AWD version will boast a more powerful output of 663 bhp. The AWD drivetrain setup includes a 295 bhp electric motor on the front axle and a 368 bhp electric motor on the rear axle. For the more economical trims, there will be LFP battery packs sourced from BYD, while the higher-end variants with larger battery packs will feature NMC battery packs from CATL. Due to the substantial weight of the battery, electric cars tend to be on the heavier side, and the Xiaomi SU7 reflects this with a curb weight of 1,980 kg for the base models and 2,205 kg for the top-tier trim. The lower variants will achieve a top speed of 210 kmph, while the higher-end models will reach 265 kmph.

Among car enthusiasts, he is also well-known for his collection of pricey and exotic vehicles. Yohan Poonawalla recently purchased a Bentley Flying Spur to add to his collection of pricey vehicles. The most potent W12 Speed variant, which retails for about Rs 7 crore, is not the standard model. Images of Yohan Poonawallas brand-new Bentley are currently making the rounds on the internet. He purchased the car in a beautiful shade of red. Industrialist Poonawalla has often stated in interviews that he loves the Bentley, Rolls Royce, and Ferrari brands, and these are the brands that most of the cars in his garage are from. Now, his passion for this high-end automobile brand is evident in his recently purchased Bentley Flying Spur. Days ago, Hottest Cars in India posted these pictures on their Instagram page. Yohan Poonawalla is seen posing with his brand-new Bentley in the images that are making the rounds on the internet.     The Flying Spur is a 4-door super-limo that offers comfort and performance, just like any other Bentley vehicle. It is an incredibly elegant sedan. A large front grille with vertical chrome slats, a chrome-finished bumper with the Bentley logo on the bonnet, and the iconic quad headlamp arrangement define the front of the vehicle. The front of this super limousine is defined by all of these components as well as the long bonnet. Turning now to the side profile of the vehicle, the big 22-inch gunmetal grey alloy wheels beautifully contrast with the cars red paint job. The lower body and rear bumper are adorned with chrome strips, and the windows are finished in brushed metal. The vehicle has all-LED taillights, and the tailgate, which displays the Bentley emblem, is where the rear windscreen and sloped roof meet the boot. Modern interior updates give the cozy cabin a more athletic appearance. The Flying Spur Speeds instrument cluster and seats have been modified and now sport Speed badging and the interiors are wrapped in Dinamica fabric. The interior is even more attractive because of the illuminated door sills. It is still unknown if Yohan Poonawalla chose to customise this Flying Spur Speed in any way. Additionally, a carbon fibre front splitter, bootlid spoiler, rear diffuser, and side skirts are among the optional extras that Bentley offers. These accessories lessen the vehicles total weight and enhance its aerodynamics.

Technological developments are changing the way traditional teaching methods are used in the field of education. A significant player in this dynamic field is DJI, which is well-known for their inventive robots and drones. The DJI RoboMaster series, which offers a wide variety of robots and drones designed for educational purposes and other product lines, stands out among its array of instructional aids. Unfortunately, the Chinese drone giant DJI has made a significant announcement today, stating that it will cease the sale of its major educational application product lines by the end of the year. The affected products include educational drones, AI artificial intelligence suites, and other related offerings. DJI made the revelation through its official website, DJI Education Application, indicating that products like Tello edu, RoboMaster EP, AI artificial intelligence suite, DJI Education Platform, and AI scenario-based education solutions will be officially discontinued on December 31, 2023. The DJI RoboMaster series, known for its diverse range of robots and drones, will no longer be available for purchase starting in January next year. The AI artificial intelligence education kit, tailored for classroom teaching in primary and secondary schools, is another casualty. Additionally, Tello EDU, an educational programming drone that facilitates learning in graphical programming, Python, and Swift, will be phased out. Educational institutions that have integrated DJIs products into their curriculum will need to explore alternative solutions as DJIs educational application product lines come to an end. This decision may prompt educators to reevaluate their technology choices for enhancing classroom experiences and hands-on learning. The DJI Education App, a comprehensive platform offering competitions and solutions such as the Mecha Master College Series and AI Artificial Intelligence Education Kit, will also be discontinued. Unfortunately, DJI has not provided explicit reasons for this strategic move, leaving users and the education community in suspense about the motivations behind discontinuing these valuable educational tools.

In partnership with renowned French glass manufacturer Saint-Gobain Sekurit, LG Electronics (LG) has announced today that it will be unveiling its cutting-edge and next-generation transparent antenna that will enhance telecommunication for automobiles at the upcoming CES 2024, slated for January in Las Vegas. The transparent film-type antenna, according to the tech giant, is poised to be a game-changer in this rapidly evolving landscape of the automobile industry.  With electric vehicles becoming the norm and the imminent arrival of autonomous and software-defined vehicles, the automotive industry is on the brink of a connectivity revolution. LGs transparent telematics solution offers a transformative approach to in-vehicle connectivity. This cutting-edge antenna can be installed directly on car glass and is made to work with many kinds of glass and car designs, so the integration procedure will be smooth.

Rinchen Norbu Wangchuk In November 2019, Narain Karthikeyan, the first ever Indian Formula 1 driver and a standout figure in the world of Indian motorsports, was competing in Fuji, Japan, at the Super GT x DTM Dream Race for the Honda-backed Moduko Nakajima Racing team. After winning the race, Narain thought he would come back to the team and compete the following year since he had another year left on his contract. But fast forward a couple of months and the COVID-19 pandemic struck which resulted in everything getting shut down, including the prospect of racing in Japan the following season. Although Narain would compete again at the Asian Le Mans Series for Racing Team India in 2021, the pandemic triggered a long held desireto become an entrepreneur. The travel restrictions were quite difficult and racing came to a premature halt. What competing in high-level motorsports like Formula One has done is help me get connected with the entire automotive ecosystem. And if I ever ventured into putting a business together, it had to be related to automobiles, Narain explains in a conversation with The Better India. For Narain, the focus had to be on affordable mobility since it was the need of the hour. As this 2020 KPMG report stated, With the need for social distancing and hygiene, coupled with financial constraints, consumers are expected to prefer affordable personal mobility modes. Affordable mobility was the need of the hour. Backed by this vision, we started DriveX Mobility, a brand-agnostic mobility platform in the pre-owned two-wheeler category that caters to different needs of the affordable mobility sector in India. Since founding it, weve built a robust tech platform and are probably in a position to become market leaders in the segment, he says. Started With Rs 80, Engineer's Homemade Biryani Business Earns Her Rs 1 Lakh/Month Incorporated in April 2020, DriveX Mobility claims to provide top quality refurbished two-wheelers to customers and allows them to buy two-wheelers at reasonable prices. In August 2022, Indian two-wheeler giant TVS Motor Company acquired a significant 48.27% stake in the pre-owned two-wheeler platform for a hefty INR 85.41 crore. Elaborating on their decision to buy a stake in DriveX, Sudarshan Venu, Managing Director at TVS, said in a press release, The pre-owned two-wheeler market is largely unorganised today. Narain and his team have built a unique platform that can scale up quickly. DriveX has a vision to bring a change in this segment by building trust, assurance, and transparency through end-to-end, high-quality products and customer experience through innovative solutions. Farm Labourer to CEO of a Billion Dollar Firm: Jyothi Reddy's Incredible Journey Employing around 250 people, delivering 2,500 units a month (from 15 in August 2020) and acquiring external funding of about $11 million over two rounds, DriveX has risen very quickly. Late last month, they even announced the opening of 10 new dealerships across India. Born and raised in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, Narain grew up amidst people who share a unique love for automobiles. Theres a huge culture of racing and rallying in Coimbatore. Its a city where engineering seems to be one of the hallmarks. A lot of people modify their cars and that culture still exists. So, I think it was natural that growing up there I would discover a passion for cars and bikes. And my father GR Karthikeyan (a former Indian national rally champion) also used to rally. Thats how I got hooked onto automobiles, I suppose, he explains. But did he ever envision becoming a professional race car driver competing in Formula 1? As Narain explains, The ambition was always there. When I was around maybe 10 or 11 years old, I caught the bug. I started following Formula One at that time. It was quite difficult to even view the races on TV because we had to get recorded tapes from my relatives who lived in the United Kingdom. These tapes would be sent in a courier package. Only after a month or so after the races, you were able to watch them. It was great growing up with like-minded friends and family. So, at a very early stage, I thought maybe I could become Indias first Formula One driver. And thats how the dream evolved from there on, he adds. 'Girl With a Broken Neck' to One of India's Youngest CEOs: Radhika Gupta's Incredible Story Suffice to say, Narain fulfilled his dream. After shining in a series of international motorsport competitions in the late nineties and the early noughties like the Formula Asia Championship, British Formula 3 Championship, Formula Nippon F3000 Championship and the Nissan World Series, Narain made his F1 debut with the Jordan team in 2005. In his debut season, Narain achieved his highest F1 finish of fourth place at the 2005 United States Grand Prix. After competing for a further seven seasons at the highest level of the sport, Narain moved on to different pastures and created a unique legacy for himself. For his achievements in motorsports, Narain was awarded the Padma Shri in 2010.  In April 2020, Narain founded DriveX alongside Christopher Sargunam. After a career in race car driving, why did he decide to venture into pre-owned two-wheelers of all things? As a business, the opportunity for two-wheelers, especially in the pre-owned space, is very large in India. Its about one and a half times the size of the new two-wheeler market. But this pre-owned vehicle two-wheeler space has largely been transacted through an unorganised broker network. For customers, we add a lot of value to these pre-owned two-wheeler bikes. These bikes became more sustainable and efficient. We give customers wanting to purchase a pre-owned vehicle an experience of a new two-wheeler, claims Narain. We have our refurbishing (refurb) factories. We have our touch points, i.e. own retail outlets & dealer outlets. And the experience a customer goes through with us is pretty close to what he or she would have gone through while buying a new bike. That is the amount of value weve been able to add. Plus, were also giving our customers one-year warranty service. So, the framework is built very similar to a brand new two-wheeler. Thats the thought behind this whole DriveX as a platform, he adds. But why not four-wheelers then? Entrepreneur Turns 500 Tonnes of Waste into Black Gold, Earns Turnover of Crores In the last 10 years, a lot of digital platforms have evolved in the pre-owned four-wheeler market. We took the right decision to get into pre-owned two-wheelers or else we would have been one amongst the 20 players selling cars. On a personal note, my first love was always bikes. But somewhere down the line I got more interested in racing cars, explains Narain. DriveX sources pre-owned two-wheelers from C2B (customer to business) and B2B (business to business) channels. After sourcing, these pre-owned two-wheelers make their way to the startups in-house refurbishing factories in Hosur and Coimbatore. We refurbish these vehicles to the highest quality standards. We also have OEM (original equipment manufacturers) support from the likes of Bajaj, TVS and others with OES (original equipment supplier) parts. After refurbishing these bikes, we have currently 38 outlets/touch points/dealerships where we retail these vehicles from, he claims. As Narain notes, there are a lot of challenges in terms of getting the right parts and suppliers. What has helped us a great deal is the digitalisation of these spare parts. When a technician wants a certain spare part, he or she can scan for this product on a digital platform weve integrated into our back office. At the level one inspection itself, we know exactly what parts to acquire and our just-in-time inventory management system helps us a lot in achieving a quick turnaround. Of course, weve not perfected this process yet, he says. We are still one-and-a-half years old as a venture. So, we keep evolving and the more data that comes in, the better we will become. The cataloguing of these parts is the most important part of this venture or else the time taken to refurbish it is extreme, he adds. Not too long ago, Narain claims that this process from sourcing to putting out these refurbished vehicles in the market took about 90 days per vehicle. Today, our turnaround time is about 45 days and we are evolving. We are evolving as we get more data and finetune our process. The target is to further reduce this turnaround time by half. This is possible because we have a good team which also receives a little external help. We have good garage software. So, all these elements are helping us to get that TAT (turnaround time) even lower. But, as stated earlier, its a very complex task. Given our rate of progress, we should be able to bring down the turnaround time every quarter, he claims. What has also helped Narain is his ability to leverage his nearly three decade-long experience as a professional motorsport athlete into this business. Formula One is a business and a sport as well. There are a lot of parallels in terms of getting the right team to get the desired results. Im extremely happy to say that weve put together a very strong team who eats, breathes and sleeps two-wheelers; especially. At our two refurbishing centres, for example, we employ north of 150-odd technicians. And, its (automotive industry) a very small community; you know the people in the market. So, we were quickly able to put a great team together. Thats what has driven the business, he claims. Its also about understanding the processes. These are pre-owned two wheelers that require servicing. For example, you need to see if there is carbon build up in the cylinder head. You need to see if the valves are seated properly, the clutch works properly and so on. We use the latest borescopes, which means you dont have to disassemble the engine to examine whether it requires any fixes, and this helps us reduce the turnaround time, he adds. Thus far, DriveX has been able to generate funding to the tune of USD 11 million in their Seed and Series-A rounds in December 2021 and October 2022 respectively. As the business grows, we need more capital of course. We want to first do some more expansion pan-India and then hopefully we will be in a much stronger position to do a Series B round as well, he claims. Given a growing shift to electric vehicles (EVs) in India, Narain believes that DriveX will eventually pivot to pre-owned two-wheeler EVs. But in India, the IC-engine market is going to be around for a long time, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and towns. These are aspirational people and the market is still going to be large for ICE vehicles, especially two-wheelers. Its a tried and proven technology, and will be around for a long time, he says. So, we want to keep putting out quality products. If we do that, we will be around for decades. The size of the market is $25 million per annum. There is a lot of scope to become a very large platform and our complete focus is in India, he adds. He also acknowledges what a different challenge this will be compared to his career in motorsports. Ive been a professional athlete for most of my life, but this is a completely different challenge. Im still far away from being a successful entrepreneur. As a digital platform, well continue to evolve. But ultimately, putting these quality vehicles on the road will determine our future as DriveX. We have everything there to make this successful, he says.

Although this list does not encompass all the elaborate achievements of women, here are 10 of the most memorable causes for celebration. Christina Hammock Koch, American engineer and NASA astronaut, will be the first woman to ever head to the moon. In April, the US-basedNational Aeronautics and Space Administration announced four astronauts to take on the lunar mission, out of which Koch was the first woman and Victor Glover will be the first black man. All the previous missions by NASA were carried out by white men, but the Administration is now determined to be inclusive of people of colour and women. Better late than never. 44-year-oldKoch holds the record for the longest continuous time in space by a woman, 328 days. With NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, she participated in the first all-female spacewalk in October 2019. Claudia Goldin became the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Economics sans a co-author. Notably, she won the Nobel Prize for studying the obstacles women face in obtaining equal pay. She is a professor of economics at Harvard University, and was awarded for ""having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes, the Nobel Prize organisation noted. Dong Hong Juan from China achieved the great feat ofconquering all 14 peaks of Mount Shishapangma in Tibet, all of which are over 8,000 metres high. She was accompanied by two guides from Imagine Nepal, an adventure facilitator organisation, and set to climb all peaks from 2015, completing her journey in April this year. South African sailor, Kirsten Neuschfer became the first woman to sail around the world and win the Golden Globe Race (GGR) in January. Since the Golden Globe marathons first started in 1968, no woman has been able to achieve the winning title until this year. Neuschfer is the first woman to win any round-the-world sailing race and also the first South African sailor ever to win a global event. The GGR is a retro sailing race in which the entrants single-handedly circumnavigate around the globe, solo, nonstop by using boats with technology only available to someone in the 60s. Ernst and Young (EY) announced on November 15 that Janet Truncale will take over as the firm's Global Chair and CEO, from July next year, making her the first female professional to lead a Big Four firm.Truncale first joined EY as an intern in 1991 and is currently the Vice Chairperson and Regional Managing Partner of the EY Americas Financial Services Organization. Greta Gerwig made history when her cult film Barbieachieved the biggest debut ever for a film directed by a female artist, Her film made$162 million in just North American ticket sales. She has been credited with several more highly regarded films like Little Women and Lady Bird.  Gerwig will be serving as the jury president at next year's Cannes Film Festival, one of the most prestigious entertainment events, calling her a ""heroine of modern our times."" Her films have served a feminist view on characters, especially women, eschewing stereotypical archetypes. Beyonc became the most awarded artist in Grammy history this year, across artists of all genders, shining with 32 trophies. This year, she won the Grammy in the Best Dance/Electronic Album category. Her Rennaisance tour took the world by storm, and the tour film was recently released. Not only is Beyonc's achievement and worldwide reach a remarkable feat for women artists, but also a torchbearer to the talent and representation of people of colour. Not only did Taylor Swift script history as the only woman to appear twice on the TIME Person Of The Year cover, she also became the first woman to gather 100 million active listeners on Spotify this year. She has become a household name all over the world as a beloved musician, especially since her Era's Tour. She also broke box office records with her tour film. US Vice President Kamala Harris became the first female leader to address the US Army Academy graduates at this year's West Point graduation ceremony. In the academy's 221-year history, no woman has ever received the honour of being the keynote speaker at the ceremony. ""Cadets, today you come to the end of what I am sure will prove to be 47 of the most challenging and rewarding months of your life... On behalf of our Commander-in-Chief, President Joe Biden, and our entire nation  Cadets, it is my honour to congratulate you on taking your place in the Long Gray Line,"" she said in her speech. President pro tempore of the US Senate, Patty Murray, made history in April as the first woman to cast a 10,000th vote on the Senate floor. She was Washington's first female US senator and the first woman in American history to hold the position of president pro tempore. Only 32 other senators, all male, have been able to achieve this milestone to date. Senator Murray has been the senior US Senator from Washington since 1993.

Will Women Rickshaw Drivers Transform Maharashtra's Transport?,"The launch of the 'Pink Rickshaws' scheme in Maharashtra takes a significant step towards empowering women economically while addressing the pressing need for safer transportation options. By offering employment opportunities in the transportation sector, will the scheme also enhance women's economic agency and address the crucial need for safer commuting options?",https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/pink-rickshaws-transport-maharashtra-women-rickshaw-drivers-2018777?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"0                             Powered by :                               Follow Us Image Credits: The Indian Express The initiative, led by Women and Child Development Minister Aditi Tatkare, aims to provide a source of livelihood for underprivileged women in major metro cities, including Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur. The blueprint of the scheme involves introducing pink e-rickshaws driven by women in ten cities across Maharashtra. In a presentation to Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar, the Women and Child Department outlined a comprehensive plan. Under this plan, the government commits to a 20% subsidy for unemployed women seeking to purchase a rickshaw. Applicants will be responsible for 10% of the cost, while the remaining 70% will be covered through bank loans. Minister Aditi Tatkare emphasized that 'Pink Rickshaws' serve a dual purpose by not only creating employment opportunities for women but also addressing the crucial need for secure modes of transportation for women in urban areas. The scheme is poised to bring about positive change by providing a reliable and safe means of commuting for women. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar responded positively to the scheme, acknowledging its potential to uplift the socio-economic status of women in the state. The government's support, as indicated by Pawar's favorable response, underlines the commitment to fostering inclusive initiatives that contribute to women's empowerment. Dr. Prashant Narnaware, the commissioner of the Women and Child Development Department, revealed that the initial proposal targets the introduction of 5,000 pink rickshaws in the first year. These rickshaws are slated to operate across key cities, including Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik, Chatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, and Nagpur. The plan envisions an expansive network of 'Pink Rickshaws,' bringing the benefits of this empowering initiative to diverse regions. As per the proposed plan, women applicants will contribute a mere 10% of the rickshaw cost, with the state government extending a 20% subsidy. The remaining 70% will be covered through bank loans, facilitating access to these vehicles for aspiring women entrepreneurs. The choice of e-rickshaws aligns with the scheme's commitment to environmental sustainability, as these vehicles are not only eco-friendly but also require less maintenance. The 'Pink Rickshaws' initiative in Maharashtra represents a groundbreaking effort to empower women economically and enhance their safety in urban transportation. With Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's endorsement and a robust implementation plan, this scheme holds the promise of transforming the lives of thousands of women by providing them with a means of livelihood and contributing to a safer, more inclusive urban environment. As the 'Pink Rickshaws' hit the streets of Maharashtra, they symbolize a step towards a more equitable and progressive society.    Subscribe to our Newsletter!

But the majority of complaints are against Ola Electric, which, at 35%, has the largest market share in the India EV two-wheeler market. Social media platforms are the only option for disgruntled customers trying to reach companies to address their issues. Several users that The Core spoke to said that they felt they had no other recourse than to post their grievances on X, since companies would otherwise not respond. The primary challenges that customers are facing involve complaints of battery draining quickly, glitches with the motor control unit (MCU), and hardware issues, among others. The second aspect of the problem involves a struggle to actually get the companies to address these issues and fix them. In September, Midhun Sankar from Ernakulam, Kerala was riding his Ola S1 Pro scooter, when it suddenly came to a halt. The screen showed that there was an error and it had gone into park mode. Its charging dipped from 24% to 3%. After restarting, it came back to 24%, and I rode it for 1-2 minutes, but again the same error came, and it went fully dead on me, Sankar told The Core, adding that the display also stopped working. I had to push it for 2km to my friends home, I connected the charger there, fortunately, it got booted up and charged. Sankar said that he raised the issue almost immediately, but only after several social media posts did the company send roadside assistance to take the scooter to the service centre a week later. Until the time his scooter was in the service centre - another week - there was no communication from them. I kept calling 10-20 times everyday after a lot of posts on social media they called back, he said. The company didnt tell him what the issue was with his battery, but that it needed to be replaced and it would take a month. He brought the scooter back to use in the meantime, but he noticed that the scooters panels had been fitted incorrectly. I called the service centre and they told me they'll resolve it while changing the batteryits been two months and Im still waiting for battery replacement and panel refitment, he said. In November, he completed one year of purchase. This represents a larger issue at hand, as the country pushes for greater adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and users make the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs  a completely different technology. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are still focused on perfecting a nascent technology and ironing out glitches. However, companies are failing to address behavioural challenges for new users, slow after-sales services and gaps in skilling. Unless companies provide smooth customer experience post sales, they risk turning away potential buyers. According to a September survey by McKinsey, battery issues and safety were among the top 10 criteria that users in India considered when looking to buy an electric two-wheeler. Additionally, most users in India rely on positive word-of-mouth reviews before deciding which brand to buy. The ongoing issues have put many potential users in a wait-and-watch mode, according to experts. This could possibly dent Indias ambitions to convert 80% of two and three-wheelers in the country to electric by 2030. Many users highlight a similar lack of reciprocity in their complaints. A TVS iQube user from Bengaluru, who has been facing an issue with his motor control unit for one and a half year, told this reporter that it would take several requests to get a response and despite visits to the service centre his issue hasnt been resolved. After several posts on X, the company generated a new ticket for him recently. They never made any sort of communication to rectify the issue even after mailing themthen on 1st December I decided to visit the service centre where they took the complainafter multiple comments and messages to TVS I got my ticket number now again, but still they havent resolved previous ticket, the Bengaluru-based TVS iQube user, requesting anonymity, said. Kulbhushan Pendharkar, from Madhya Pradesh, who had purchased an Ola S1 Pro for his sister in March, sent over 150 emails to the company. Frustrated, he said he knew their computerised responses by heart now. Pendharkar has been facing a host of problems for over a month and a half including the scooters battery draining and issues with the seat. You can reach out to them either through their app, or via email, he said, adding that he continuously tried both. The app will generate a ticket, and on the email you get a computerised response after which the ticket is automatically closed. Several other users have complained of the same issue. On their app it always shows slots full, if you have any issue and want to visit their centre for repair, another Ola Electric user, whose scooter has broken down thrice in 11 months, alleged. He, like many other users, also complained how repairmen would call them after several requests only to later become unresponsive or block their numbers. Another issue that investigations revealed was gaps in skilling. Electric vehicles use different technology from the ones required by traditional petrol or diesel vehicles. Most often, technicians are not adequately equipped to address a new technology. Electric vehicles run on a battery and a motor, as opposed to an engine. And the skills required for this new technology are very different. Many users complained that when they finally got service for issues, technicians appeared overwhelmed, and often could not correctly address the grievance. For instance, Sankar's scooter came back with ill-fitted panels. The TVS iQube user also complained that most of my parts were broken by the service centre and here and there they just fixed it with a locking string. Another Ola electric user in Uttar Pradesh added that technicians are under huge pressure. My scooter has a fault in the motor control unit, but due to a lack of proper technical knowledge, the technician is unable to resolve this issue, he said. The lack of third party repairmen also adds to the frustration and helplessness for users who are completely dependent on the OEM. They should have methods like Activa, where local garages are able to repair the vehicle, one user told The Core. Except battery, all other issues should be resolved at local garages rather than relying on them, he added. And this kind of user experience faced by existing users has an impact on potential buyers, as Indians are economical and weigh every aspect before making any purchase, especially in automobiles. India is a very value conscious market, Rohan Kanwar Gupta, vice president and sector head in corporate ratings firm ICRA, told The Core. This definitely affects the decision of a user in purchasing an electric vehicle. And it is not limited to calculating just the upfront cost or total cost of ownership. Pendharkar, for instance, complained that despite paying for the Ola Care+ plan, which costs Rs 2,999 annually, he hasnt received any service or support from the company. We purchased the scooter for my sister who has to commute 45-50 km daily for workwith the battery drain issue she cant use the scooter regularly, he said. He also said that it had been lying idle for over 15 days now. Another user based in Maharashtra complained that he hadnt even been able to use his Ola S1 Air scooter due to repeated issues after purchase. I booked it on 14th August, got it delivered on 9th Octoberthe battery draining issue started just a week or two after buying the scooter, he said. It stayed in the service centre for eight days, and when it came back, the problem still persisted. He took it back to the centre where they said his battery would be replaced. The scooter is still not returnedyou can see that it's not really been much time since I got the scooter and I didn't even get to enjoy it much, he said. Another user, whose vehicle has had several issues in the 11 months since purchase, called it pure torture. I sold my Activa to buy Ola and now [Im] paying Rs 6,145 in EMI for three yearshow to operate daily life without a vehicle? he said. It is not uncommon for consumers to face teething issues with any new technology. In the case of electric vehicles too, a knowledge gap exists in user behaviour. While issues with the motor control unit are usually a manufacturing defect, battery issues can be caused by user behaviour. If you speed up too much for instance, it can affect your battery, Naveen Sharma, who works as an engineer with a D2C EV brand, told The Core. Similarly, when users put too much load on their vehicle, which might be over the weight the vehicle can carry, it can affect the battery life, he added. Charging methods too can affect it. Users told The Core that they were not told what caused issues in their vehicles, and OEMs did not educate enough about the right way to maintain their scooters to avoid issues. On a visit to an Ola Electric service centre in Thane, The Core was told that the company sends regular notifications to users for certain battery charging issues. Ola Electric has not responded to multiple queries on this from The Core. In fact, users seem to rely on social media forums with other EV users on X, Telegram, and WhatsApp for knowledge and information on issues related to their vehicles. A look at some of these forums reveals that while companies like Ola Electric and Ather Energy do share user stats and some dos and don'ts (Ather Energy shared a list on how to keep your vehicle safe in the rains during the recent floods in Chennai), a lot of the knowledge being shared is based on user experience itself. It will take time for the overall ecosystem also to evolve  for the consumers to become informed about how a particular product needs to be run, and for the roadside servicemen to actually gain that kind of knowledge to service the issues that are faced on a day to day basis, Gupta said. It is still too early to say whether bad customer experience has a direct impact on sales of electric scooters. It would be wrong to say that they have not had an impact, Gupta said. He explained that hypothetically if there was no worry over safety issues or service issues, the number of sales in November couldve been higher. But nobody can point out that impact in terms of numbers, he said. The impact in terms of user perception, however, is clearer. Recent issues of overheating, excessive/ sudden battery drainage and other technical faults have dented the confidence of potential customers and as a result, some of them have adopted a wait-and-watch approach, Jeffry Jacob, partner and national sector leader, automotive, KPMG in India, told The Core. Both Jacob and Gupta said that knowledge enhancement and confidence building initiatives are already being undertaken by leading manufacturers. This is likely to be a short term blip and the overall long term growth story continues to be strong, said Jacob. He also said that the company expects EV penetration in scooters to reach about 70-75% by 2030. It's a matter of ecosystem developing over a period of time, and say for the next couple of years, these kinds of teething issues will actually continue to remain, Gupta added. However, potential customers tend to check with other users and friends regarding performance of models, and after sales support by manufacturers, Jacob pointed out. For instance, Pendharkar chose to purchase an Ola S1 Pro scooter because a friend suggested it to him. When asked if he would recommend the brand, or a different brand to someone else, he replied, I wouldnt recommend any right now. Companies are failing to address behavioural challenges for new users, slow services and gaps in skilling. Unless they provide smooth customer experience post sales, they risk turning away potential buyers.",

"Tesla Autopilot not ready, makes public roads unsafe: Ex-employee","Lukasz Krupski, a former Tesla employee, told BBC that the company's self-driving technology 'Autopilot' is not ready but his concerns were ignored internally. ""It affects all of us because we are essentially experiments on public roads,"" he said. ""So even if you don't have a Tesla, your children still walk on the footpath,"" he added.",https://www.outlookindia.com/international/us/former-tesla-employee-now-a-whistleblower-exposes-alleged-safety-issues-in-self-driving-technology-news-334912/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Connect with us Former Tesla employee Lukasz Krupski warns that 'we are essentially experiments in public roads' as he raises concerns about the security and functionality of Tesla's self-driving technology. Krupski's disclosures have triggered investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulatory bodies.  Updated on: 6 December 2023 9:36 am A former Tesla employee has told the BBC he believes the technology behind the company's self-driving cars isn't sufficiently secure for public road use. In May, Lukasz Krupski disclosed data, including customer complaints regarding Tesla's braking and self-driving software, to the German newspaper Handelsblatt. He mentioned that his attempts to raise concerns internally were disregarded. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has been a vocal advocate for the company's self-driving technology. ""Tesla has by far the best real-world AI,"" Mr Musk said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday. But, during his initial interview in the UK, Mr. Krupski expressed to Zoe Kleinman, the BBC's technology editor, his apprehensions regarding the use of AI in powering Tesla's autopilot service. For instance, its autopilot feature encompasses assisted steering and parking. However, despite its name, it still necessitates someone in the driver's seat maintaining hands on the wheel. ""I don't think the hardware is ready and the software is ready,"" he said. ""It affects all of us because we are essentially experiments in public roads. So even if you don't have a Tesla, your children still walk in the footpath."" Mr. Krupski revealed that he discovered evidence in the company's data indicating that the stipulated requirements for the safe operation of vehicles with a specific level of autonomous or assistive-driving technology were not adhered to. He further mentioned that Tesla employees had approached him, discussing instances of vehicles unexpectedly breaking in response to non-existent obstacles, commonly referred to as ""phantom braking."" This issue was also reflected in the data he acquired from customer complaints. As per Tesla's internal data, by the conclusion of 2022, U.S. customers utilizing Autopilot experienced an average of one crash with deployed airbags approximately every 5 million miles traveled. The overall average for U.S. drivers was approximately one crash every 600,000 miles. It's important to note that the BBC could not independently verify Tesla's figures. Mr. Krupski said that he had felt an obligation to disclose his findings to data protection authorities. Since January, the U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting an investigation into Tesla over its claims relating to its assisted driving features. Tesla has been subject to inquiries and scrutiny from various agencies, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, regarding its autopilot system. The ""Tesla Files"" were published by the German newspaper Handelsblatt, following Mr. Krupski's sharing of 100GB of internal data that he came across. The data protection authority in the Netherlands, where Tesla's European headquarters are located, confirmed to the BBC that it had received notification of the data breach and was investigating the claim. Mr. Krupski described the past six months and his experience as a whistleblower as ""terrifying."" ""I barely sleep at night sometimes,"" he told the BBC. However, others have acknowledged his actions, and he has been honored with the Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing Prize. Jack Stilgoe, an associate professor at University College London specializing in autonomous vehicles research, stated that Mr. Krupski's claims raise broader concerns about the technology. ""This is a sort of test case of artificial intelligence in the wild, on the open road, surrounded by all the rest of us,"" he said. In early November, the UK Government unveiled intentions to introduce an Automated Vehicles Bill, aiming to establish a legal framework for self-driving cars, as mentioned in the King's Speech. ""We'll have to see as the bill gets developed whether it grapples with all of the novel things about the technology,"" Prof Stilgoe added.",2023-12-06

ONE’s dual-chemistry battery powers BMW iX 608 miles,"Our Next Energy's Gemini dual-chemistry battery achieved 608.1 miles of range in a BMW iX on a single charge. The milestone was achieved using a WLTP test cycle. ""The Gemini battery has proven it can double the range of EVs and break down the biggest barrier to electrification,"" said Mujeeb Ijaz, CEO & founder of ONE.",https://www.inceptivemind.com/ones-dual-chemistry-battery-boosts-bmw-ix-electric-range-978-km/35704/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Michigan-based battery startup Our Next Energy (ONE) has made a significant breakthrough in the field of energy storage technology. The company has announced that its Gemini dual-chemistry battery has achieved an impressive 608.1 miles (978.6 km) of range in a BMW iX on a single charge. This milestone was achieved using a WLTP test cycle, which is the European standard for determining the range of fully electric vehicles. Geminis unique dual-chemistry architecture is designed to provide maximum range and sustainability. Gemini is capable of providing 450 Wh/L of energy density at a system level and 185+ kWh of energy in the space allotted to typical passenger EV packs. It features two different cell types that use different battery chemistries. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells power the motor and provide enough energy to meet the demands of 99% of daily trips with a range of 150 miles (241 km) or less. For longer road trips, the Gemini uses high energy density anode-free (AF) cells that serve as range extenders for an additional 450 miles (724 km) of range by transferring power through ONEs proprietary high-efficiency DC-to-DC converter. The energy density of these AF cells is just over 1,000 Wh/L, which is more than double the energy density of the LFP cells at 441 Wh/L. The two cells work together, coupled by the DC-to-DC converter, to offer more than 600 miles (965 km) on a single charge. Whats more, Gemini is the longest-range EV battery pack that can fit in the typical 300-400 liter space available in a vehicle for energy storage. Apart from the extended range, ONEs Gemini technology also reduces the use of lithium by up to 20%, graphite by 60%, nickel usage by 75%, and minimizes the use of nickel and cobalt. This makes it a more sustainable and cost-effective energy storage technology that can lower the environmental impact and cost of EVs. Electric vehicles will achieve mass adoption when they offer enough range that people will feel comfortable having an EV as their only vehicle, said Mujeeb Ijaz, CEO & founder of ONE. The Gemini battery has proven it can double the range of EVs and break down the biggest barrier to electrification. Last year, ONE signed an agreement with BMW Group to demonstrate the Gemini battery technology in a less aerodynamic electric vehicle. The BMW iX is a high-performance Sports Activity Vehicle that has a WLTP range between 257 and 392 miles (414 and 630 km) depending on the battery size, motors, and wheels installed. The initial test results showed that a BMW iX equipped with a prototype Gemini battery was able to travel for just over the 600 miles (966 km) target on a charge, thanks to the Geminis dual-chemistry cell split. Now that ONE has successfully demonstrated the Gemini technology, the company will focus on further refinements to the system to prepare for commercialization. These include improving the DC-to-DC converter efficiency, developing enhanced control algorithms to optimize usage of the range extender cells, and conducting further battery validation and cell development. All these steps are intended to further improve the range and to prepare for the development of an A-sample for a full production program. ONE plans to increase its LFP cell production in 2024 and aims to achieve a capacity of 20 GWh from its new factory in Van Buren, Michigan. Additionally, the company is working towards completing the development of its low-cost manganese cells, with the goal of being production-ready for the Gemini pack by around 2026.

""Musk is so active on X that he'll...let us know when Tesla is setting up in India,"" Goyal said at 'India Business Leader Awards', adding, ""Another seven years, and every new vehicle sold in India will be EV.""",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/ibla-2023-tesla-wont-want-to-miss-out-on-ev-action-in-india-says-piyush-goyal-11844541.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Electric vehicle (EV) major Tesla will not want to miss out on the ""action"" in India, according to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. Speaking at the 'India Business Leader Awards' on December 2, Goyal also said that a real growth rate of 7 percent on average could result in India becoming a $35 trillion economy in another 25-27 years. ""Mr Musk is so active on X that he will be the person who'll let us know when Tesla is setting up in India,"" Goyal said in response to a question on when the US-based EV heavyweight will set up shop in India, with speculation rife on the same. Also Read: Model Y could be the first model Tesla rolls out in India ""The age of electric vehicles has arrived. In another two to three years, I see all new two-wheeler sales being electric. In three-wheeler sales, we are close to 100 percent electric or CNG-driven,"" Goyal said, adding that while the figure for four-wheelers was only around 2 percent, the future was bright as local manufacturers - Maruti, Tata, and Mahindra, among others - were coming out with ""some fantastic offerings."" ""We will see a lot of action in the four-wheeler space. Therefore, Tesla will not like to miss out on the action,"" the commerce minister said. Speaking more broadly on the Indian economy, Goyal said India's per capita income will be close to $20,000 by 2047, with a GDP of around $35 trillion in another 27 years time even if the real growth rate averaged a conservative 7 percent. ""Even if we were to grow at 7 percent per year on average  although I sense that our growth will accelerate going forward and inch toward a double-digit number  and 4-4.5 percent inflation, this gives us nominal growth of 11-11.5 percent. Assuming rupee depreciation of 1-1.5 percent per year, that gives us nominal growth of 10 percent in US dollar terms. So that means it will take 7 years to double our economy in US dollar terms. It should not take more than 25-27 years to be a $35 trillion economy,"" Goyal said. Also Read: India's July-September GDP growth at 7.6%, sharply above forecasts On inflation, Goyal commented that it has been largely under control, except for the issues caused by global developments, and that the government was constantly taking steps to keep prices stable. ""We remain a step ahead of the curve, and I can assure the people of India that we will make sure that you will continue to get your high-quality foodstuff at an affordable price,"" he said.",

A CCTV footage from doorbell camera showed one of the thieves holding up an antenna to pick up signal from the owner's key. The thieves were able to trick the system into unlocking the car and drive off without triggering alarms.,https://www.news18.com/amp/viral/caught-on-camera-thieves-steal-rolls-royce-in-mere-seconds-8688300.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Curated By: Buzz Staff Trending Desk Last Updated: December 02, 2023, 17:45 IST Using an advanced method of cloning the key signal with an antenna, high-tech criminals executed a heist targeting the Rolls Royce Cullinan, in Aveley, Essex, UK. Valued at over Rs 8 crore in India and often exceeding Rs 15 crore with customisations, this luxury SUV stands as one of the most expensive in the world. The meticulously planned heist was captured on CCTV. The thieves employed a technique where one individual used what appeared to be an antenna-shaped wire to unlock and start the Cullinan parked outside a house. The entire operation unfolded in mere seconds, with no signs of typical theft techniques like hot-wiring or forced entry. The thieves used a clever trick to steal the Rolls Royce Cullinan. They exploited the cars keyless entry feature, which works with a key fob. The luxury cars keys were found inside the residence. In the footage, a hooded individual can be seen holding a wire antenna. Using an antenna to amplify the signal, the thieves tricked the system into unlocking the car and enabling them to drive off without triggering alarms. Watch the video here:   A video of the heist has surfaced online. The audacity and technological prowess of the thieves have left the viewers in shock. Authorities are currently investigating the incident. In many cases, after high-end cars are stolen, they are often sold in the black market or shipped to other countries for profit. In some instances, valuable parts, such as high-end audio systems, are dismantled and sold in the market. While the thieves intentions in this case are not clear, no arrests have been made so far, and the police are on the lookout for them.

It has been identified that due to an improper process being followed to manufacture the rubber parts of rear stop light switch there are chances of crack development on the rubber, the two-wheeler maker said in a statement. This might cause water entry and corrosion inside the switch, leading the light to malfunction, it added. Units manufactured between October 2020 to January 2023 are affected, HMSI stated without divulging the number of affected units. The recall is also due to an inappropriate moulding procedure of sensor housing. It was observed that a gap might occur in sensor body sealing which may cause water entry inside the bank angle sensor. This leads to chances of possible sensor malfunction and vehicle stalling in the worst situation. Units manufactured between October 2020 to December 2021 are affected, HMSI said. As a precautionary measure, the replacement of the affected parts will be carried out at BigWing dealerships across India starting from the second week of December 2023, it noted. The replacement will be done free of cost irrespective of the warranty status of the vehicle, it added.",

"Tesla sells ₹4,500 broken window sticker inspired by Musk's famous Cybertruck mishap","Tesla is selling broken window decal for Cybertruck for $55 (₹4,500). The sticker is inspired by the unveiling of the pickup truck in 2019, when Tesla's design chief threw a steel ball at the bulletproof truck's window to demonstrate its strength and the glass shattered. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had reacted to it then saying, ""Oh my f*****g God.""",https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/cybertruck-broken-window-sticker-tesla?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Join the news democracyWhere your votes decide the Top 100 Elon Musk is now selling Tesla Cybertruck broken window stickers Elon Musk is selling window stickers for Teslas Cybertruck which make it look like they have been smashed. The billionaire posted the stickers on X/Twitter on 1 December, in an apparent reference to a botched 2019 demonstration of the electric trucks armoured glass, when a small metal ball smashed the window unexpectedly. The product, listed as Cybertruck OMFG decal is on sale for $55 in the US, and comes a day after the first vehicles rolled off the production line and went out for delivery on Thursday 30 November. The name is a reference to Musks response to the ball smashing the glass, when he said: Oh my f****** god. Well, maybe that was a little too hard. The Tesla boss went on to blame the order in which the demo took place for the mishap, which was viewed millions of times and widely mocked online. Musk said: Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time. Tesla started deliveries of the much-hyped Cybertruck after years of delays, amid reports of problems around the quality of the product. Early pre-production models have been reported to have multiple quality issues around the fit and finish. That includes large gaps between the panels, and bubbles or other defects in the plastic film on the outside. Despite this, the Cybertruck is Teslas first new model in nearly four years, and could be a make-or-break moment for the car maker.  We dug our own grave with Cybertruck, Musk said last month, and warned that it could take 18 months for the product to start making significant amounts of money for the company. The Cybertruck pricing starts at $60,990, over 50% more than what Musk initially touted in 2019. The futuristic design is part of Musks ambition to build a tough truck which would be fit for an apocalypse. As the finished product goes out into the world over the coming days, Tesla bosses will have their fingers crossed the worst embarrassments are behind them.

Together, we can create a brighter future by shaping opinions, driving conversations, and transforming ideas into reality. The third quarter of 2023 witnessed a remarkable surge in the dynamic landscape of new energy vehicles (NEVs), with a total sales volume of 3.455 million vehicles, marking a substantial 28.1% YoY increase. Pure electric vehicles (BEVs) claimed the lions share, constituting around 70% of the sales, according to statistics released by TrendForce. Tesla emerged as the frontrunner, securing the top rank in sales. However, the gap between Tesla and BYD, the second-place contender, has notably narrowed. The sales volume difference in the third quarter was less than a thousand units, and when factoring in BYDs Denza brand, it surpassed Tesla. Despite Teslas ongoing price reductions, the focus on the 260,000 to 300,000 price range has created a distinct market positioning, primarily targeting first- and second-tier cities. BYD has risen to a competitive position against Tesla thanks to its strategic positioning and the addition of Denza to the sales calculation. The gradual changes in market conditions underscore BYDs strategy of serving a wider range of customers, which helps explain the narrowing sales disparity. Tesla and BYD lead the pack with 18% each, topping the first ten global sales ranking of pure electric vehicles in the third quarter of the year, followed by GAC Eon (5.8%), Volkswagen (4.8%), and SAIC-GM-Wuling (4.6%). BMW with 3.4% market share, Hyundai with 2.6%, and Mercedes-Benz with 2.5% spot the 6th, 7th, and 8th positions respectively. Notably, NIO, absent from the list for an extended period, secured the 9th position, indicating its resurgence in the market, while Kia, with 2.1%, maintained the 10th spot. On the other hand, the sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars (PHEVs) were strong, with BYD taking the lead. Lili took second place with a 10% market share and her first-ever quarterly sales of over 100,000. While Mercedes-Benz and BMW continued to be stable, worries about them being replaced, if not rapidly growing, persisted. Meanwhile, according to TrendForces forecasts, the market for new energy cars is expected to rise by 32% by 2024, with a total volume of 17 million vehicles expected. A dynamic and revolutionary future for electric vehicles is being determined by the fierce competition among major competitors as the industry develops.

Besides, Tata Motors and Mercedes-Benz India are mulling increasing the prices of their models from January. The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India, which sells a range of vehicles from entry-level small car Alto to multi-utility vehicle Invicto, priced between Rs 3.54 lakh and Rs 28.42 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), on November 27 said the price hike would vary from model to model. In an interaction with PTI, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) Senior Executive Officer (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava said the price hike would be ""substantial"" in some models. ""There is an inflationary pressure all around, including volatility in commodities, so that is the reason we have decided to increase the prices in January,"" he noted. MSI had last hiked vehicle prices by 0.8 per cent in April this year. It had effected a total price increase of 2.4 per cent last fiscal. ""There is no choice left for us now but to enhance the prices. We are yet to figure out the exact quantum of the increase,"" Srivastava said. Earlier, in a regulatory filing, MSI said the company has planned to increase the prices of its cars in January 2024 on account of increased cost pressure driven by overall inflation and increased commodity prices. ""While the company makes maximum efforts to reduce cost and offset the increase, it may have to pass on some increase to the market. This price increase shall vary across models,"" it said. Mahindra and Mahindra CEO (Automotive Division) Nalinikanth Gollagunta said that based on the inflation and commodity prices outlook, ""we intend to take a price increase for our automotive products effective January 2024. The details for which will be announced closer to the time, he said in a statement. Mahindra & Mahindra, one of the leading SUV manufacturers in the country on December 6 announced a price hike for its SUV and CV range, effective January 2024. This adjustment is in response to the rising costs due to inflation and increased commodity prices. Mahindra has made efforts to absorb as much of these additional costs as possible. However, a portion of this increase will be passed on to customers. The extent of the price increase will vary across different SUVs and commercial vehicles. Tata Motors is also considering increasing the price of its passenger and electric vehicles in January 2024. The company, which sells a range of passenger vehicles starting with hatchback Tiago to premium SUV Safari priced between Rs 5.6 lakh and Rs 25.94 lakh, also did not specify the quantum of the proposed hike. ""We are considering a price hike across our passenger and electric vehicles in January 2024. The extent of the hike and exact details will be announced in a few weeks,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson said on November 27. Earlier in the day, German luxury car maker Audi said it will hike the prices of its vehicles in India by up to 2 percent from January next year, citing rising input and operational costs. The price hike will be effective from January 1, 2024, and will be across the model range, Audi India said in a statement. ""Due to rising supply chain-related input and operational costs, we have effected a price correction across our model range, maintaining the brand's premium price positioning,"" Audi India Head Balbir Singh Dhillon said in a statement. Further, he said the price correction aims to ensure sustainable growth for Audi India and our dealer partners, and ""we will ensure that the price hike's impact is as minimal as possible for customers.""

Insane: Musk on dispute of 7 shops affecting Tesla ops in Sweden,"World's richest man Elon Musk said it's ""insane"" how a labour dispute in Sweden affecting seven repair shops is hampering Tesla's operations in largest Nordic country. Dockworkers, garbage collectors, electricians and postal workers have now refused to do any of Tesla's tasks as nine unions protest against Tesla. Negotiations have stopped as repair-shop strikes are about to enter fifth week.",https://www.bqprime.com/world/elon-musk-calls-swedish-tesla-strikes-insane-as-impact-spreads?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk said its insane how a labor dispute in Sweden affecting seven repair shops has spread to hamper Tesla Inc.s operations in the largest Nordic country. Dockworkers, garbage collectors, electricians and postal workers now refuse to do any tasks related to Tesla, after their trade groups stepped in to support the Swedish industrial workers union IF Metall thats been striking since Oct. 27. Nine unions are now part of the blockade on the maker of electric vehicles. Swedish labor unions have wide-ranging rights, enshrined in law, to join action on behalf of their peers. In contrast, similar moves are tightly regulated or outright banned in several other European countries. The postal workers protest specifically ired Musk. Its preventing the Swedish Transport Agency from delivering license plates to new Tesla cars as regulations allow no other delivery than by post. That means no new Teslas can be taken into use in Sweden. The chief executive officer and co-founder of the automaker was made aware of the fact in a post on X, the platform he owns that was previously known as Twitter, prompting his response: This is insane. His intervention underscores how the parties to the dispute are digging in. As the repair-shop strikes are about to enter their fifth week, negotiations have ground to a halt. The chief mediator between the two parties told Swedish business daily Dagens Industri on Tuesday that Teslas subsidiary in Sweden has zero maneuvering room to sign any deal with the union, and said it is on orders straight from Elon Musk.

Tesla ready to invest $2bn in India if it gets 15% subsidy: Report,"Tesla is ready to invest $2 billion in India by building a local factory if it gets 15% concessional duty on imported EVs during first two years of operations, The Economic Times reported. Tesla is willing to invest $500 million if concessions are given for 12,000 EVs. It may invest $2 billion if concessions are given for 30,000 EVs.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-605-11802341.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"#1. Corporate capex slows down in first half of fiscal year on moderating revenue growth Indias top listed companies are going slow on fresh investment in capacity expansion as theres a deceleration in their revenue growth. The ratio between turnover, or net sales or revenue, to assets for 725 companies in a Business Standard sample declined to 0.437 in the six months to March from 0.446 and 0.442 in the first half of 2023-24. Why its important: The government has boosted capital spending in recent years, expecting the private sector to follow, which does not seem to be happening. Companies are focused on expanding margins and profits rather than investing in growth, mainly due to subdued consumer demand. #2. Tesla ready to invest $2 billion to build factory but wants concessions on imported vehicles Tesla is willing to invest up to $2 billion to establish a factory in India if the government approves a concessional duty of 15 percent on imported vehicles during its first two years of operations in India. The electric carmaker is willing to invest up to $500 million if the government extends concessional tariff for 12,000 vehicles and can increase this up to $2 billion if the reduced duty is approved for 30,000 vehicles. Why its important: The government is said to be considering the upper range of Teslas proposal although it has earlier indicated reluctance to provide any duty concessions on imported vehicles. #3. Company registrars step up action on violations after decriminalisation regime kicks in Indias various registrars of companies have stepped up action after the 2019 decriminalisation of various company law violations, resulting in a near fivefold jump in orders in just four years. These orders entail a penalty but no prosecution. The registrars under the corporate affairs ministry issued 157 such orders in 2019, a number that jumped to 765 in 2023 till November 22, official data showed. Why its important: The decriminalisation regime has evidently eased the load on the judicial system, as was expected, and has freed up companies to focus on their business. #4. B2B marketplace OfBusiness looks to raise $200 million at $6 billion valuation Business-to-business marketplace OfBusiness has approached sovereign wealth funds, and private equity and crossover funds to raise $150-200 million in fresh investment, seeking a valuation of $6 billion. It was last valued at $5 billion in 2021 when it raised $325 million. OfBusiness has raised nearly $900 million in 11 funding rounds, of which $802 million came in 2021. Why its important: The B2B unicorn is already profitable, raising hopes that it might secure the desired funding in a market environment where liquidity has dried up for the larger start-up ecosystem. #5. Control exuberant lending, finance minister asks NDFCs and small finance banks Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reiterated the Reserve Bank of Indias caution to lenders to avoid downside risks, while focusing on their core business. Sitharaman warned non-banking financial companies and small finance banks to avoid risks from over-lending. The central bank last week increases the risk weights on consumer loans and loans to NBFCs to slow down the pace of unsecured credit growth. Why its important: The finance ministers caution comes a day after Reserve Bank governor sounded a similar note of caution on risky lending to minimize risks to stability of the financial ecosystem. #6. Infrastructure financiers rush to bond market to raise Rs 30,000 crore Financiers in the country are approaching bond markets to raise capital for infrastructure projects, with big names such as the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development and large public sector banks eyeing fund raises worth close to Rs 30,000 crore. NABFID is eyeing a bond sale worth Rs 10,000 crore, while the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway aims to garner Rs 3,000 crore. Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank are looking to raise Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore. Why its important: The huge bond pipeline comes ahead of the crucial parliamentary elections in 2024 and is taking place at a time when sovereign bond yields have eased significantly from the highs in October. #7. Discounted deals make a comeback for sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday Local companies have started discounts, both online and offline, for Black Friday on November 24 and Cyber Monday soon after, with e-commerce firms, retailers and marquee brands wooing customers with lucrative deals. While Diwali purchases are mostly for gifting, industry experts said Black Friday is more about making those purchases that consumers have on their wish lists Why its important: Black Friday typically signals the start of Christmas shopping in Western markets but is increasingly becoming an integral part of the retail calendar in the country. #8. Distressed airline Go First gets 90 more days to ready revival plan The National Company Law Tribunal has extended the moratorium period for Go First airline by an additional 90 days till February 4 under the insolvency resolution process. Failure to complete the corporate insolvency resolution process within the extended timeline might force initiation of a liquidation process, the tribunal said. Why its important: This extension provides a breather to Go First, which is facing legal challenges from lessors and the government order allowing them to reclaim aircraft and engines. #9. New finance commission to give high weightage to human development index The central government is likely to ask the next Finance Commission to consider a higher weight for the human development index and sustainable development goals while recommending the distribution of resources among states.

If the development turns out to be true, this will be the second model to be considered by the San Carlos, California-based EV maker for India, after Model Y. Earlier,Moneycontrolhad exclusively reported that Model Y crossover will be the first model to be available in the country.

India closing in on Tesla deal to set up plant in 2 years: Report,"India is closing in on an agreement with Tesla to set up a factory in the country within two years, Bloomberg reported.

Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are frontrunners for the factory's location as they already have well-established ecosystems for EVs and exports.",https://www.bqprime.com/bloomberg/india-closer-to-agreement-with-tesla-to-import-evs-set-up-plant?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) --  India is closing in on an agreement with Tesla Inc. that would allow the US automaker to ship its electric cars to the country from next year and set up a factory within two years, according to people familiar with the Indian governments thinking. An announcement could come at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit in January, one of the people said, declining to be identified because the discussions are private. The states of Gujarat, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modis home base, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are under consideration because they already have well-established ecosystems for electric vehicles and exports, another person said. Tesla would commit an initial minimum investment in any plant of around $2 billion, one person said, and would look to increase purchases of auto parts from the nation to as much as $15 billion. The US automaker would also seek to make some batteries in India to bring down costs, the person said. Read more: India EV-Linked Stocks Gain on Report of Likely Pact With Tesla No final decision has been made and the plans could change, the people said. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in June that Tesla plans to make a significant investment in India and he intends to visit in 2024. Representatives from Indias Ministry of Heavy Industries, which oversees the automobile sector, and the ministries of finance, and commerce and industry, didnt respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didnt respond to a request for comment. Breaking into the worlds most-populous nation, where demand for electric vehicles is growing among aspirational middle-class consumers, would be a potential boon for Tesla, which currently has factories in the US, China and Germany. Modis government has been pushing to increase domestic manufacturing of EVs and encourage a more rapid adoption of cleaner transport. Despite those efforts, Indias EV market has a long way to go, with battery-powered cars accounting for just 1.3% of the total passenger vehicles sold last year, according to BloombergNEF. Buyers are hesitant to make the switch due to electric cars high upfront cost and a dearth of charging stations. Tesla doesnt import cars directly into India because of the high tariffs that are levied. When its first locally made cars do go on sale, they could retail for as little as $20,000, some of the people said. Trade Minister Piyush Goyal, who visited Teslas plant in Fremont, California, earlier this month, said in September that Tesla is planning to almost double purchases of auto parts from India to $1.9 billion this year. The electric-car maker sourced parts worth $1 billion from the nation last year, he said at an event in New Delhi at the time. Tesla and India, which is the worlds third-largest auto market, reopened dialog in May following a yearlong impasse. Musk has criticized Indias high import taxes and its EV policies, and India, in turn, has advised Tesla not to sell cars in the country that have been made in China, its political rival. India is now said to be considering lowering import taxes for international EV manufacturers for a period of five years if those firms eventually commit to setting up local factories.

Aston Martin owner sells F1 team stake at $1.2bn valuation: Report,"Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin's part-owner, sold a minority stake in the company's F1 team to US' Arctos Partners at a $1.2-billion valuation, Bloomberg reported. This is the first time Stroll has sold stake in the team, which his son Lance drives for. This comes as the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix is being held from November 16-18.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/aston-martin-owner-stroll-sells-f1-stake-at-1-billion-valuation?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- With Formula 1 preparing for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll has sold a minority stake in the Aston Martin team to US private equity firm Arctos Partners. The investment by Arctos, which has a stake in the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool Football Club owner Fenway Sports Group, values the F1 team at about a 1 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation, according to a person familiar with the deal. It is the first time Stroll has sold shares in the F1 team, which his son Lance drives for. He is also the largest shareholder in Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc, the British luxury carmaker. Aston Martins other F1 driver  Fernando Alonso  is currently fourth in the standings. Bloomberg reported last month that Aston Martin team had been approached by potential backers. The Formula One teams appreciated in value significantly over the last few years due to the popularity of the sport, due to cost caps, Stroll said at Aston Martins F1 headquarters at Silverstone, the home of the British Grand Prix. So, weve had conversations, but theres nothing on the cards. Formula 1s Las Vegas Race Isnt Living Up to the Hype The deal comes on the eve of the much-hyped Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend and shows the growing appeal of F1 in the US, the Aston Martin team said in a statement on Thursday. It is the latest in a string of deals and rising valuations in F1, which has seen its popularity soar in the US thanks largely to the success of the Netflix documentary series . In June, Renaults F1 team Alpine secured 200 million from RedBird Capital and Otro Capital, as well as actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, valuing it at 800 million. MSP Sports Capital led a funding round into McLarens F1 team in December 2020, which also included Walmart heir Rob Walton, Bloomberg News reported last month. The investment valued McLaren at 560 million, the company said at the time. Vegas is the third F1 Grand Prix to be held in the US this season after races in Miami and Austin. Liberty Media Corp. has invested heavily in marketing the sport in the US since buying the sport in 2017. The funding for the F1 team comes as Stroll continues to try to turn around the listed carmaker, which he rescued in 2020. The group has since carried out multiple capital raises, bringing in investors such as Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund. The terms and the valuation of the F1 deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, were not disclosed. Raine Group advised Aston Martin on the investment.

The esteemed roadster, held by an American collector for an impressive 38 years, outshone expectations, surpassed all expectations, trailing only behind the astounding $135 million sale of a Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe in 2022. With todays exchange rate, that equates to a staggering $144 million. Despite earlier predictions exceeding $60 million by RM Sothebys, the luxury car subsidiary, the 250 GTO took center stage in the auction room, captivating the audience and securing a slightly lower but still breathtaking bid. The identity of the new owner remains a delightful mystery. Reflecting on its 1962 origins, this Scuderia legend, with chassis 3765 and a four-litre engine producing 390 bhp, has woven itself into history with a second-place finish at the Nurburgring and the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans. After gracing tracks in Italy and Sicily, the car embarked on a transatlantic journey in the late 1960s. Undergoing restoration and modification, the 250 GTO passed through several American owners before landing in the hands of an Ohio-based dedicated collector"" in 1985, who, after nearly four decades of stewardship, propelled it back into the market on Monday. Sothebys, describing the GTO as more than just a car, painted it as a spectacle for touring, vintage racing, or display at major concours delegance and marque gatherings worldwide,"" adding another chapter to its rich and storied history. The exceptional Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe, which claimed the top spot at 135 million euros in 2022, remains a rare gem, with only two known examples. Sold in a confidential auction at the German manufacturers museum in Stuttgart, it stands as the most expensive car ever sold globally, either at auction or privately, according to a RM Sothebys spokesperson. As the autumn season of art sales draws to a close for New York auction houses Sothebys and Christies, standing resilient in the face of challenging times, the market, fueled by the warmth from China and Asia, shows no signs of slowing down, according to the comforting assurances from Sothebys. Michael Caimano of RM Sothebys, echoing this sentiment, compared the Ferrari to a tangible work of art, emphasizing its timeless allure and collectors appeal, transcending the fluctuations of financial markets.

The move comes as the US-based electric car maker explores the possibility of setting up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla has approached New Delhi seeking an initial tariff cut to offset India's high customs duties, the UK-based Financial Times reported, citing two officials with knowledge of the matter. India levies a 100 percent duty on fully imported cars with a CIF (cost, insurance and freight) value surpassing $40,000. For cars valued below this threshold, the duty imposed is 70 percent. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report. Last week, this website reported that Tesla is planning to initiate its presence in India with direct imports from its German Gigafactory, although a specific timeline for its entry into the Indian market has not been finalised. The top management at Tesla has been explicitly advised by Indian ministries not to import cars from China because of tensions between New Delhi and Beijing, a source working in an advisory capacity with the company told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity. Also Read |MC Exclusive: Tesla likely to import completely built up EVs from German facility to India Tesla has reportedly sought the tariff cut as a prerequisite for setting up the manufacturing facility. If approved, the reduced tariffs wouldn't be specific to Tesla but would extend to all EV manufacturers.

As of date, the proposed policy has not been finalised or officially agreed upon within the Indian government.

The meeting between Goyal and Musk will be the most high-profile one since the Tesla boss met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June and later said he was keen to make significant investments in the country. Discussions between the Musk and Goyal in the US will centre around Tesla's plans to setup an Indian factory, manufacturing a $24,000 car there, sourcing more components and establishing charging infrastructure across the nation, one of the two sources told Reuters. A discussion is also likely on a new policy India is working on which will allow automakers to import fully built EVs into India at a reduced tax rate of 15%, down from as much as 100% now, if they commit to some local manufacturing. This meeting is to ensure that talks between India and Tesla ""are moving in the right direction,"" the person added. India's commerce ministry and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla and India have been in talks for several months with the U.S. carmaker open to setting up a factory but also keen to get lower import taxes for some of its high-end vehicles. Prime Minister Modi's office held a meeting with various ministries on Monday to expedite the new EV policy, said a third source. The third person added the government is also analysing the impact the new policy could have on the Indian EV market, as local carmakers have often said lower EV import taxes could disrupt the market and hurt their plans. Tesla first tried to enter India in 2021, pushing officials to lower the 100% import tax for EVs, but last year the talks collapsed when officials conveyed the company would have to first commit to local manufacturing.",

Taking design cues from the original Himalayan, the Electric Himalayan Testbed is aimed at sustainable adventure on two wheels, the Bullet maker said during the unveiling at the EICMA Motor Show in Milan on Tuesday. The Electric Himalayan Testbed is much more than a design concept. For us, this is our vision and a glimpse of what to expect from us in the future, said Mario Alvisi, chief growth officer of electric vehicles at Royal Enfield. ""There is a much larger electric mobility blueprint that is being brought alive at Royal Enfield, as we continue to work on multiple electrifying expressions of pure motorcycling."" The Electric Himalayan builds on the spartan character of the original that was launched in 2016, but with the advantages of an electric powertrain. An in-house designed battery box serves as the main structural element, or the stressed member of the chassis.  The objective for the project was not to see how many batteries could be squeezed into a motorcycle. Instead, it was aimed at clean and sustainable motorcycling. The EV was tested in the Himalayas, as well as the wind tunnel to improve efficiency and ride quality. The Himalayan in its various avatars: (from left) the discontinued 411, the new 452 and the electric testbed.

The investment was aimed at a long-term partnership for research and development, technology sharing and licensing, and manufacturing of electric two-wheelers. ""Stark Future has been able to understand and harness the potential of EV technology by dramatically outperforming ICE (internal combustion engine) offerings, without compromising on the range, weight, packaging and cost,"" Royal Enfield's Managing Director Siddhartha Lal had said then. ""They have created an absolutely astounding motocross motorcycle, the Stark VARG, as their entry into the EV world.""

Tesla's shares closed at $200.84/share on Nasdaq on Tuesday, down over 21% from October 17.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/tesla-tsla-erases-145-billion-in-valuation-as-demand-woes-intensify?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares have wiped out nearly one-fifth of their value in less than two weeks amid growing concerns that demand for electric cars is starting to weaken. The selloff started earlier this month when the electric-vehicle giant dialed back growth expectations during its third quarter earnings call. That was followed by grim commentary from several global automakers, as well as Wall Street analysts. This week, battery-maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. and chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp. also sounded alarms for the EV industry. The warnings have weighed on stocks across the US automotive sector, which has also been battling extensive negotiations with its labor unions over wages. Still, Teslas decline stands out: shares have sunk over 17% since the Oct. 18 report, compared to a 2.8% drop in the S&P 500 Index, and a 3.4% decline in the Nasdaq 100. The retreat in the EV-makers stock price has erased about $130 billion from the companys market capitalization. At the crux of the problem is a capital-intensive sector investing in unproven EV strategies amid a world of rising costs, lower prices, rising rates and slower demand, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note discussing the wider industry weakness Tuesday. What investors seem to be waking up to today is the idea that the tens of billions of dollars invested in EVs may be value destructive rather than value accretive. The outlook for autos overall has been darkening as high interest rates have sent the cost to own a car soaring. When coupled with rising inflation, consumers ability to afford big purchases has been squeezed. EVs, still a relatively new technology with an underdeveloped charging ecosystem, are getting hit first. As a pureplay EV maker with an eye-watering valuation, the stakes are high for Tesla. While some part of its expensive share price reflects its potential to develop self-driving cars, a large part depends on the companys ability to maintain its current dominant position in the EV industry and its profit margins.  As EV demand tapers and Teslas aggressive price cuts seem to be losing their ability to boost demand much further, investors are starting to get jittery, reflected in the sharp slide in the share price. Still, the stock staged a sharp rebound around midday in New York after the company convinced a jury that its Autopilot technology wasnt responsible for a crash that killed a California driver four years ago. The shares closed up 1.8% at $200.84 on Tuesday. (Updates stock move, valuation in third paragraph and headline, adds more stock detail in eighth.)

Afghanistan's viral supercar 'Simurgh' makes global debut; pics surface,"Afghanistan's supercar 'Simurgh' made its global debut at the Doha edition of the Geneva International Motor Show. The first-ever indigenous supercar from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, it went viral when a Taliban spokesman shared a video of an earlier version of the vehicle. The car, which runs on a four-cylinder engine, took a team of 30 people, five years to build.",https://www.bqprime.com/pursuits/afghanistan-s-viral-supercar-makes-global-debut-at-doha-show?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- At first glance, the Simurgh resembles the Batmobile. Black, low-slung with flared wheel arches, the supercar looks built for speed. Look a bit closer though, and its clear this car is different to the dozens of other vehicles on display at the Doha edition of the Geneva International Motor Show. The sealing on the windshield is uneven, and visitors werent allowed to open the doors  because the interiors havent been finished yet. But perhaps the Simurghs most unusual feature is its country of origin: Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized control two years ago. Named after a mythical Persian bird with the head of a dog, claws of a lion and big enough to carry off an elephant or whale, the Simurgh took a team of 30 people five years to build, Entop Chief Executive Officer Mohammad Reza Ahmadi said. The project was delayed by the pandemic and the collapse of the Afghan economy after the Taliban takeover, said Ahmadi, who also acts as chief engineer and designer. While Afghanistans rugged mountain roads are more suited to sturdy four-wheel drives and sport utility vehicles, Ahmadi said he wanted to make something different.  I want to build something to put my country on the map again, he said in an interview at the Doha show. The Simurgh represents the heroes and art of Afghanistan. A SUV wont be the same. The car, which runs on a four-cylinder engine, was unveiled in late 2022. It went viral in January when a Taliban spokesman shared a video of an earlier version of the vehicle, then known as the Mada9. A crowd of the former insurgents was seen admiring the car in the video. Its a jarring image from a poverty-stricken country with one of the worlds worst human-rights records. The Taliban has enacted sweeping restrictions against women, banning them from education, working, visiting public parks, using gyms, and traveling long distances without a male escort. But Ahmadi wants the public to see the Simurgh as representing a different side of Afghanistan. He and his team managed to get the car to Doha, its first international showing, after crowd-funding $130,000 from more than 45,000 people. The next goal for Entop is to raise 30 million ($32 million) to perfect the Simurgh and enter it at Le Mans  the famed 24-hour endurance race in France.  We plan to start sales after the Simurgh has been through Le Mans, where it can be tested and prove itself, said Ahmadi. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com 2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

About EEOC News and Information Laws and Enforcement Programs and Performance Data and Analytics Inside EEOC Employees & Applicants Filing a Charge of Discrimination Discrimination by Type Employers / Small Business Small Business Resource Center Discrimination by Type Federal Agencies Federal Employees & Job Applicants Resources in Other Languages FREMONT, Calif.  Electric car maker Tesla, Inc., violated federal law by tolerating widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees and by subjecting some of these workers to retaliation for opposing the harassment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today. According to the EEOCs suit, since at least 2015 to the present, Black employees at Teslas Fremont, California manufacturing facilities have routinely endured racial abuse, pervasive stereotyping, and hostility as well as epithets such as variations of the N-word, monkey, boy, and black b*tch. Slurs were used casually and openly in high-traffic areas and at worker hubs. Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line, the EEOC said. The EEOCs investigation also found that those who raised objections to racial hostility suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions. The EEOC investigated Tesla after EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows filed a commissioners charge alleging that Tesla violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by subjecting Black employees to an unlawful hostile work environment and retaliating against employees for opposing harassment. Title VII prohibits racial harassment and requires employers who receive harassment complaints to take prompt and appropriate action to investigate and stop it. After first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through conciliation, the EEOC filed its lawsuit (EEOC v Tesla, Inc., Case No. 4:23-cv-04984) in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The EEOCs lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, and back pay for the affected workers, as well as injunctive relief designed to reform Teslas employment practices to prevent such discrimination in the future. Combatting systemic harassment in workplaces is a key strategic enforcement priority for the EEOC. Unfortunately, as the lawsuits EEOC has filed this fiscal year show, racial harassment remains a persistent problem in employment. Every employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed, said Burrows. Todays lawsuit makes clear that no company is above the law, and the EEOC will vigorously enforce federal civil rights protections to help ensure American workplaces are free from unlawful harassment and retaliation. EEOC San Francisco District Office Director Nancy Sienko said, When you let a standard slip, youve set a new standard. Determining that prolific racial slurs do not merit serious discipline and failing to correct harassing conduct sends an entirely wrong message to employees. It also violates an employers legal responsibility to act swiftly and effectively to stop race-based harassment. EEOC San Francisco District Office Regional Attorney Roberta L. Steele said, The allegations in this case are disturbing. No worker should have to endure racial harassment and retaliation to earn a living six decades after the enactment of Title VII. For more information on race discrimination, please visit https://www.eeoc.gov/racecolor-discrimination. For more information on harassment, please visit https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment. The litigation of this case will be led by Senior Trial Attorney James Baker and Assistant Regional Attorney Marcia Mitchell. The suit was brought by the EEOCs San Francisco District Office, which has jurisdiction over Northern California, Northern Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Idaho and Montana. The San Francisco District has offices in Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle. The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. More information is available at www.eeoc.gov.

India considering Tesla bid for incentives to set up plant: Report,"Centre is considering Elon Musk-owned Tesla's request for incentives to set up a testing hub in India, a senior government official told Moneycontrol. The government feels there will be benefits in bringing the industry to India, but there's room for negotiations, the official said. The government may look at offering benefits if there's a model to scale, the official added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/mc-exclusive-govt-considering-teslas-request-for-benefits-to-set-up-testing-hub-11442391.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The world's largest electric car producer, Tesla Inc., has sought benefits from the government of India to set up destructive testing for specific components and testing tracks for all vehicles in the country, which the government is mulling over. The government feels there will be benefits in bringing the concept industry to the country, but there is room for a lot of negotiations, a senior government official said. Tesla has proposed to set up innovation and destructive testing hubs for specific components in India. India has the largest variety of roads. If Tesla conducts destructive testing in India, the company can roll out its cars anywhere in the world. Tesla has discussed this with the Indian government and has been asking for some benefits. India has been considering that, the official told Moneycontrol. The testing tracks and destructive testing are cost-intensive and skillset-intensive initiatives. However, they could bring benefits to India and the automobile ecosystem in terms of technology and innovation. Destructive testing is a method of destroying a component or material to analyse its point of failure. In this technique, a component is subjected to different destructive methods to deform it completely. Its flexibility and strength are then assessed to understand how that material performs under pressure. Tesla is seeking to set up testing tracks for all models of vehicles. It is space-rich, skillset-rich, and cost-intensive. In the Indian ecosystem, both labour-intensive and cost-intensive sectors work. The discussions between Tesla executives and the government have taken place on this matter. Bringing this concept industry to India will benefit the country, he said. India may look at offering some benefits if there is a model to scale it in the automobile sector. There is great scope for negotiations, and any decision will be taken by line ministries, including the Ministry of Heavy Industries, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. There is a lot of room to negotiate in this space. It is for the line ministries to take a decision, the official said. Currently, India has the National Automotive Test Tracks in Madhya Pradesh, including the High-Speed Track, the Multi-Friction Braking Track, the Gradient Track, the Fatigue Track, the Gravel and Off-Road Track, and the Comfort Track. It's a flagship project of the Ministry of Heavy Industries. Manufacturing unit Meanwhile, on reports of Tesla looking at setting up a manufacturing unit in India, the official said that the government has concerns about the quantum of labour and employment the facility may need, as the high-tech electric car assembly lines tend to be vastly automated. On the speculation of tax benefits to Tesla for electric cars, the official reiterated that the government is not looking at concessions towards high-end electric vehicles (EVs). EVs for use by the common people or by the new generation will receive tax benefits. High-end EVs will not get tax benefits. However, the tax benefits already given by the government to EVs have been substantial. Why should we give any more? he said. Tesla manufactures high-end electric cars costing over $40,000 and is continuously innovating towards auto-pilot features and concept cars. The US-based electric vehicle maker is into driverless cars, high-end EVs, concept vehicles, etc. ""Until the concept is proven and there is a cost-benefit association, the government does not enter the scene to give them tax concessions for manufacturing or imports, he said. Emails for comments to the Ministry of Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, and Tesla remained unanswered.",

People spending more on automobiles due to YOLO factor: FADA Prez,"Automobile industry body FADA's President Manish Raj Singhania told Moneycontrol that consumers are spending more on automobiles due to the 'You Only Live Once (YOLO)' factor. ""We're...seeing reports that savings are at an all-time low in India. So people aren't saving and are rather spending money on automobiles, etc,"" Singhania said. ""Psyche of the customer has also changed,"" he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/consumers-are-spending-more-on-automobiles-due-to-yolo-factor-fada-president-manish-raj-singhania-11412191.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Founded in 1964, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) is the apex national body of the retail automobile industry engaged in the sale and service of 2/3-wheelers, passenger vehicles (PVs), SUVs, commercial vehicles and tractors. Talking exclusively to Moneycontrol, FADA President Manish Raj Singhania said that despite ongoing challenges in the economy, consumers are spending more on automobiles as they believe in the YOLO (You Only Live Once) philosophy. Edited excerpts: How has this month been for the auto dealer fraternity in terms of sales, especially of passenger vehicles and two-wheelers? Since last month, we have seen decent growth of about 10 percent across all segments. We have created new records as PV sales were the highest ever for the month of August (3,15,153 units). This month too, the Vahan numbers have been very positive to date for both these segments. The Ganesh festival has just started and I think in the coming days the numbers will grow. Retail sales were high last year as well. But the supplies were not as per the demand. In terms of percentage, I expect to see high single-digit growth in PV sales.Over the last three to four months, we are seeing consistent growth and improvement in the two-wheeler industry as well, where we expect somewhere around 10 to 15 percent growth in September and October. Talking about the festival season, what kind of incremental growth do you foresee and what would be the key growth drivers? The festival season is a 42-day period, beginning with Navaratri and lasting until 10 days after Diwali.The sales growth is due to a combination of factors. After Covid, we have seen spending going up, especially in the premium Rs 10-20 lakh SUV segment. Sales of premium SUVs were below 20 percent of the PV market pre-Covid, but now theyre almost 50 percent of the PV market. With better roads, better finance and better supplies, personal mobility is taking off. Last year, there was a semiconductor crisisdueto which we saw waiting periods of two years. But now we are seeing waiting periods of up to six months. Moreover, new launches generate a lot of interest in this segment. While we have seen a lack of demand due to stress in the rural economy, during the last festive season, rural sales picked up on auspicious days. If that trend continues, it will bolster volumes this financial year. Are you seeing an improvement in the rural market? Yes, this year the rural condition is slightly better than last one. We have had a decent monsoon, which will ensure a decent harvest. Given that and the Minimum Support Price (MSP) offered by the government, farmers will have money in their hands, which will allow them to spend on vehicles, as mobility is a necessity and not a luxury in rural India. Many OEMs have flagged demand headwinds such as high-interest rates, inflation, rising insurance premiums, modest growth in salaries of working professionals, etc.How are you still confident of buoyancy in the market? A lot of things have come into play and the psyche of the customer has also changed. We are just seeing reports that savings are at an all-time low in India. So, people are not saving and are rather spending money on automobiles, etc. That is largely attributed to the YOLO (You Only Live once) factor. Mobility is not a luxury in India. If you look at the car penetration per 1,000 people, we are nowhere compared to global standards, so there is tremendous potential. That's why the government has been investing heavily in road infra.You may prefer going on a road trip instead of going by train or plane because your personal vehicle is always at your disposal.These are important factors that are contributing towards increasing the passenger car market. Recently, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways made an audacious statement about imposing a 10 percent additional GST on diesel vehicles. While the ministry has since backtracked, what do you think of the consumer sentiment about diesel? Whether they buy diesel (vehicles) or not, they'll still buy automobiles. Also, our diesel vehicles are now compliant with global standards. In fact, we are better than the standards of a lot of countries. So why should a particular category of vehicle be punished? We are already talking aboutBS-VII emission standards and if my product is complying with set norms, then what is the logic of taking that vehicle out of the system? Every product has a unique proposition and thats true for diesel as well. Everything is not negative about diesel and positive about petrol. We are definitely focussing on electric vehicles, ethanol, methanol, etc., and trying to get into hydrogen. It is the market dynamics which will subsequently establish a particular type of fuel. For instance, CNG is very well established in the markets it's available in. The consumer understands the logistics and economics of operating such vehicles. You don't have to convince a three-wheeler customer to buy an EV because they understand the advantages. Are you witnessing a significant penetration of EVs? At present, EV penetration for passenger cars is almost 2.5 percent, and for two-wheelers, it is about 5 percent.Among the things that need to be addressed is the price of the battery once it is mass & locally produced, and the resale value of the product after 5-7 years of ownership whenever the customer wants to upgrade. And the charging infra, which is still not in place. About 95 percent of consumers are charging their EVs at home.Once charging stations are spread across the length and breadth of the country, consumer confidence will go up and you will see the penetration of EVs grow manifold. Going forward, do you foresee a sizeable chunk of EVs being sold in the rural market? The rural market is very price sensitive and the current prices of EVs are almost twice that of an ICE vehicle. So, to address that market, we need to make entry-level EVs more affordable. And their range also has to be decent because in rural markets distances are very high. Again, the lack of charging infra is a big challenge. While EV sales in rural India will grow, it will take some time.Right now, the focus should be more on urban markets where EV adoption would be faster.",

Apart from NavIC, other popular navigation systems include the United States' Global Positioning System (GPS), Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), the European Union's Galileo, China's BeiDou, and Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). Chandrasekhar referred to a startup called Accord, which he claimed was the first Indian company to design NavIC chips. He said that the company had already manufactured over 1 million NavIC chips in 28 nanometers. In the automotive industry, since there is a chip that is available, there are sufficient reasons for the government to mandate that the trackers in India be NavIC powered, he said, adding that NavIC can be used in Thailand, Japan, Korea, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. So nothing prevents the use of the device in an automotive platform, Chandrasekhar said. NavIC in mobile devices Chandrasekhar also referred to the IT Hardware PLI scheme and mentioned that there are incentives for manufacturers who incorporate Indian-designed chips or Indian-manufactured chips. So it is conceivable that in the coming future, and it's certainly our goal that as mobile phone designs and our chip design mature and reach the granularity and the sophistication required for mobile devices that the chips themselves that power mobile devices will be NavIC chips, he said. When we have a mobile phone grid chip, which is performance, competitive, cost competitive, we will certainly incentivise mobile phone devices to incorporate that as well, he added. Apple, a few days back, incorporated support for NavIC in select models of its latest iPhone 15 series. This move appears to be in alignment with India's push to promote its homegrown alternative to the GPS navigation system. On the technical specifications page for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple has officially announced the inclusion of NavIC support.",

According to an excerpt from Isaacson's upcoming book, Musk was so focused on self-driving robotaxis that it took a team effort from Tesla executives to convince him to pursue an affordable car as well, however, the CEO only relented when his aides revealed a plan to build both the $25,000 car and Tesla's robotaxi side by side, reports Teslarati. The news was first reported by Axios. Tesla plans to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. To accomplish this, the company would require a vehicle that could be built quickly and at scale, meaning Tesla requires a vehicle with far greater output than the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Tesla's next-generation platform, which was discussed earlier this year at Investor Day, appears to be designed for this purpose, the report said.Tesla Most Wanted Car in the World: Elon Musk-Run Auto Company Tops List of Most-Searched Four-Wheeler Brand on Google, Finds Report.  As per Isaacson, Musk had a brainstorming session in November 2021 with his top five lieutenants in Austin, discussing a basic robotaxi that could be produced in high volumes. According to the report, Musk and his team spent almost a year debating whether to build a car with traditional controls or a vehicle that is fully autonomous, with no steering wheel or pedals, which would require taking a greater risk. A number of Tesla engineers reportedly pushed for a more conservative approach. During a meeting on August 18, 2022, Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen even suggested that the robotaxi could be a vehicle with steering wheels and pedals that could be removed later.Tesla Model S, Model X: Elon Musk Run-Electric Vehicle Company Unveils Cheaper Variants of Two Car Models, Check Price and Specifications.  Musk, however, was reportedly adamant. Following a meeting in September 2022, von Holzhausen and several others presented data to Musk showing that a small, global car would be needed for Tesla to achieve its ambitious growth targets. The team convinced the CEO that both the $25,000 car and the robotaxi could be built on the same next-generation platform. Both vehicles could be produced using the same assembly lines as well, the report mentioned. Musk was ultimately convinced by von Holzhausen's use of the $25,000 Tesla and robotaxi model alongside each other in Tesla's Design Studio. .  Latestly.com, 2024",

Drivers' medical and genetic information is being collected in some cases.",https://www.outlookindia.com/international/us/the-dark-side-of-smart-cars-how-thevehicle-may-be-tracking-your-sexual-acts--news-316375/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Connect with us Discover the alarming truth about smart cars and how vehicle manufacturers may be collecting and sharing your personal data. Learn from Mozilla Foundation's study and find out which car brands respect your privacy. Stay informed about the growing concerns in the automotive industry  Updated on: 7 September 2023 8:6 am In an era of increasing connectivity and technological advancements, smart cars have become the norm on our roads. However, beneath the sleek exteriors and advanced features lies a concerning reality: your vehicle might be spying on you and recording every move, inclusing your private life. A recent study conducted by the Mozilla Foundation has unveiled the unsettling truth about the extent to which car manufacturers collect and share your personal data. The study scrutinized 25 different car brands and delivered a stark verdictnone of them passed consumer privacy tests. Shockingly, a staggering 84percent of car companies were found to review, share, or even sell data collected from car owners. The collected personal data goes far beyond what is necessary for the vehicle's operation or the car brand's relationship with its drivers. Mozilla's research revealed that six car companies go to alarming lengths, collecting intimate information such as a driver's medical and genetic details, driving habits, destinations, and even their musical preferences. Nissan goes so far as to include ""sexual activity"" in the data it collects, while Kia openly acknowledges its capacity to gather information about your ""sex life"" in their privacy policy. Kia's privacy policy states that it may process ""special categories"" of data, including sensitive aspects such as race, religion, sexual orientation, and political beliefs. The extent of data collection extends beyond the car's built-in systems, encompassing connected services and third-party sources like online radio services and navigation apps. This vast amount of data isn't just sitting idle; it's being used to create profiles and make inferences about you, from your intelligence to your interests. As the automotive industry continues to embrace connectivity and autonomous driving, predictions suggest a surge in sales for services like music and video streaming, as well as driver assistance and self-driving subscriptions. These services can be highly profitable for carmakers if theycollect more customer data. Even tech giant Tesla, despite its prominence in the electric car market, failed Mozilla's criteria in security, data control, and AI. Tesla has previously faced criticism over its privacy practices, including incidents where employees shared videos and images recorded by customer car cameras. Among the car brands reviewed, 84percent admitted they could share personal data with service providers or data brokers, and 76percent confessed they could potentially sell this data. Only Renault and Dacia, both under the same parent company, explicitly stated that drivers had the right to delete their personal data. These brands, headquartered in Europe, benefit from the protection of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy law. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, questions about data security and personal privacy loom large. It remains to be seen whether car manufacturers will take the necessary steps to safeguard your personal information as the smart car revolution unfolds. In the meantime, it's essential to stay informed and vigilant about the dark side of smart cars.",2023-09-07
Deficient disk space caused shutting down of all Japan ops: Toyota,"Toyota Motor Corporation on Wednesday revealed that ""insufficient disk space"" caused shutting down of operations at all assembly plants in Japan in August. ""The system malfunction was caused by the unavailability of some multiple servers that process parts orders,"" Toyota said. ""System was restored after data was transferred to a server with a larger capacity on August 29,"" it added.",https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39732568.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Sep. 06, 2023 We would like to apologize once again to our customers, suppliers, and related parties for any inconvenience caused by the suspension of our domestic plants as a result of the malfunction in our production order system at the end of last month. The system malfunction was caused by the unavailability of some multiple servers that process parts orders. As for the circumstances, regular maintenance work was performed on August 27, the day before the malfunction occurred. During the maintenance procedure, data that had accumulated in the database was deleted and organized, and an error occurred due to insufficient disk space, causing the system to stop. Since these servers were running on the same system, a similar failure occurred in the backup function, and a switchover could not be made. This led to the suspension of domestic plant operations.

JSW Group in talks to acquire shut Ford Chennai plant: Report,"Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group is in advanced talks to acquire Ford Motor's shuttered Chennai factory for its planned entry in the EV space, Mint reported. JSW Group is talking to both the Tamil Nadu government and Ford regarding the plant, which was shut in July 2022 as part of Ford's business restructuring. The plant can produce around two lakh vehicles/year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-544-11280171.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"#1. Capital expenditure by private sector has started, finance minister says Indias private sector has begun to invest, and the economy will do well in the coming quarters, Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharaman said. India will be able to manage the spillovers of high US interest rates, she said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will return to power in 2024 as the government has delivered on its promises, the finance minister said. Why its important: The central government ratcheted up capital spending in recent years, which was not matched by new investments by the private sector. It will be good news for the economy if that changes. #2. Government slashes cooking gas prices by Rs 200 to tame inflation The price of domestic LPG cylinders has been reduced by Rs 200 for all connections, the government has announced. The reduction in price of LPG cylinder, the first change in six months, will take effect immediately and will provide relief to 314 million domestic LPG consumers. Why its important: The reduced price will ease stress in household budget grappling with persistently high inflation. The move ahead of the crucial polling season may also yield electoral dividends. #3. Maruti Suzuki to invest Rs 45,000 crore in eight years to double capacity Maruti Suzuki India, the countrys biggest automaker, will invest about Rs 45,000 crore to double its annual production capacity to 4 million units in the next eight years, chairman R C Bhargava has said during the the companys 42nd annual general meeting. The company needs to reorganize and focus on different powertrains, including for electric and hybrid vehicles, compressed natural gas, and ethanol. Why its important: Maruti is trying to pivot from an overemphasis on internal combustion engines, which follows the overall trend in the auto industry. It will require new infrastructure and support services. #4. JSW Group in advanced talks to acquire Ford factory in Chennai The Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group is in advanced discussions to buy the closed Chennai factory of Ford Motor for its planned entry into the electric vehicle space. The company is speaking with both the state government and Ford. Spread over 350 acres, the Ford factory, shut since July last year, has an annual production capacity of 200,000 vehicles and 340,000 engines. Why its important: If the acquisition goes through successfully, JSW will gain a toehold in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle sector. The Tamil Nadu government is also keen to find a new owner who can restart production. #5. Goldman Sachs likely to convert partial debt into equity in PharmEasy Goldman Sachs may convert a part of the debt it gave to PharmEasy into equity after the upcoming rights issue of about $424 million (Rs 3,500 crore) by the online pharmacy that will open on September 4. Goldman, which had issued a $300-million loan to PharmEasy, is in discussions to convert around $38-40 million debt into equity. Why its important: The rights issue is likely to value the e-pharmacy at $500-600 million, significantly lower than its peak valuation of $5.6 billion in 2021. Indias start-ups are undergoing a reality check. #6. Indias power demand and shortage smash records in August Electricity usage, which started rising in July, touched record demand in August as rainfall sputtered, driving stocks of power companies to new highs. As demand surged, power shortage also shot up. India saw a record peak shortage of 9.11 GW, or over 4 percent of the peak demand, on 21 August, when peak demand was 226GW, data from the Grid Controller showed. Generation outage stood at 51.65GW. Why its important: Electricity demand to run pumps to water farms have shot up as rains have been scanty in recent weeks. The demand is likely to remain high as the monsoon recedes over the country. #7. Government working on providing private sector access to non-sensitive data The central government is considering ways to give the private sector enhanced access to non-sensitive data on the Gati Shakti platform, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal has said. The demand from the private sector to use Gati Shakti has been overwhelming, the minister said. Why its important: Gati Shakti is intended to hasten implementation for infrastructure projects. The government needs to ensure checks and balances while letting the private sector use the platform as data leaks could be damaging. #8. Coordinated data regulation critical in connected world, Mastercard chief says When it comes to regulating the digital economy, its important in a globally connected world that there is coordinated regulation, according to Michael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard. If every country does their own, the global digitally connected economy is going to be difficult to run, he said. Why its important: India has moved to legislate on data privacy as the digital economy gathers steam. How the data is used and how it moves across borders are concerns that need to be addressed. #9. Senior executives in Big Tech open to changing employment but jobs are getting scarce There was a time when it was difficult to pin down senior Big Tech professionals for job offer conversations. Not any longer, executive search and hiring firms including Transearch, Longhouse Consulting, CIEL HR and GI Group Holdings said. Now theyre the ones who often make the first move. While those on tech functions have it easier, salaries remain a big challenge, with few hiring companies willing to match the huge packages many of these professionals currently get. Why its important: The hiring trend among senior tech executives underline the slowdown in the sector globally. Finding suitable jobs in senior management is not going to be easy. #10. India will fly to Venus and Mars with private sector as vital partner Private companies will be a crucial partner in Indias future space missions, including those to Mars and Venus, government think tank NITI Aayog member and defence scientist V.K. Saraswat has said. India is not behind any world power, including China, in technical capability, although the country needs to build scale, he said. Why its important: The private sector already plays a role in Indias space sector by making vital components. Its role will only increase in the coming years as commercial use of space technology rises.",

For 45 minutes, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO drove around the city and demonstrated the capabilities of Teslas newest Full Self-Driving (FSD) update, FSD v12, thereby breaking several laws of the land in the process. Heres everything that happened during the eventful Musk live stream. Everything was going fine initially, with Musks Tesla coursing through roads, corners and roundabouts autonomously with relative ease, but that changed in the 19th minute as the vehicle almost jumped a red light and ran head-on into a busy intersection, causing Musk to intervene. It was a scary moment! So thats our first intervention because the car should be going straight, said Musk in the video as he took control of the vehicle.That was a controlled left turn where there was a green light for the left turn but not a green light to go straight. And, so, well feed it a bunch of video of controlled left turns and then itll work. Tesla FSD beta updates are only released to the beta testers and not the public in general as they are still in the testing phase. V12 is not even out to beta testers yet. Around 27 minutes into the demo, Musk then Googled Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergs address, saying that he was going to drive to his house. This is not the first time that Musk has publicly announced to visit Zuckerbergs home. Around a few weeks ago, the Tesla CEO suggested the same in preparation for their unlikely cage match. For starters, Musk broke the rules for FSD set by Tesla itself. The company handbook states, Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. On the other hand, Musk was often visible with just one hand on the wheel in the video. Moreover, Musk also broke a city law that prohibits drivers from holding their phones while at the wheel. The initial punishment is a $20 fine, but it can result in a point getting docked on the license if the offence is repeated twice in a span of three years. Despite breaking the law, Musk wont get any punishment for the offence. The Verge reached out to the Palo Alto Police Department who mentioned that since there was no police at the scene as a witness who can testify in court about the offence, they wont be issuing fines. Full Self Driving or FSD is Tesla's suite of driver assistance features that provide an assisted driving experience and active guidance under supervision. While it is not completely autonomous, FSD aims to better the Autopilot mode in vehicles with a completely autonomous driving experience in future Tesla vehicles.

Govt considering EVs for priority sector lending: Official,"The Finance Ministry is considering a proposal to include electric vehicles under the RBI's priority sector guidelines, a move that would make it cheaper to raise funds, a government official said. The proposal was made to the Finance Ministry by the Power Ministry. ""We will discuss with the RBI, and a detailed examination will be done,"" the official added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-considering-evs-for-priority-sector-lending-official-says-11263151.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Electric vehicles and non-conventional energy including green hydrogen may come under priority sector lending with the proposal under discussion by the Finance Ministry, a senior government official said. The proposal sent by the Power Ministry will be discussed with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a review of the priority sector lending is on the cards, he added. Power ministry has asked EV to be included under priority sector lending in a letter. We will talk to the RBI. There will be a detailed examination and a review of the priority sector lending. Other non conventional energy including green hydrogen are also seeking inclusion under priority sector lending, the official said. Under the rules, a banking entity needs to lend 40 percent of the adjusted net bank credit to the so-called priority sector or economically weaker sections. Sections like agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises, export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure, renewable energy, etc., are included for lending purposes under PSL. The apex banks norms are applicable to all the commercial banks, small finance banks (SFBs), cooperative banks and foreign banks. Mooted by the then Finance Minister Morarji Desai in 1966, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) brought in priority sector lending (PSL) norms for banks in 1972 to boost credit access to and development of economically weaker sections. Other than lending, the priority sector lending norms also prescribe banks to ensure that the loans extended under it are for approved purposes and the end use is continuously monitored. For this, banks are advised to put in place a proper internal control system. For compliance and monitoring purposes, banks are also required to submit data on lending to the RBIs Financial Inclusion and Development Department. If a bank fails to meet the target prescribed under thePSL norms, it has to deposit the allocated amount for contribution to the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) established with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development as decided by the apex bank from time to time. Also, the PSL norms clearly mention that any non-achievement of the prescribed targets under PSL is considered while granting regulatory clearances or any approvals for various purposes.",

Jamess car reached the blistering speed of 152.50 km/h (94.76 mph), and were it not for an unfortunate crash, his car could potentially have set a record over double that speed. James said in a video on his channel that this was the most stressful, draining, and heartbreaking project hes ever done. There was no previous record holder, however, Jamess car was required to register a minimum speed of 150 km/h (93.2 mph) to be awarded the Guinness World Records title. James spent three months prior to the record attempt constructing, testing, and perfecting his car. Hed been working on the project for over a year, building the first iteration of the car in 2022. Although this car wasnt able to set the record, James learnt a lot about how to build a bigger, more powerful version. His record-setting car was powered by a JetCat 220 engine, fixed to a strong aluminium chassis with a 3D-printed nose and lots of electronic gizmos to make it all work. James first tested it at a local racetrack, where it performed brilliantly, reaching a speed of 70 mph, but James knew that the car could go much faster. He said it had only been using a fraction of the available power and he didnt make it go full throttle. James knew that if he had a longer, wider surface to drive it on, the car could attain a record-setting speed. Thus, he attended the ROSSA speed event at Llanbedr Airport runway, where radio-controlled car enthusiasts gathered to drive their model vehicles as fast as possible.  James didnt have time to develop bespoke tyres for the car, so he used standard foam tyres, hoping that theyd survive the insane speeds that the car would reach at full throttle. One of the challenges that James faced was the weather. Despite it being the beginning of July, there were lengthy spells of rain and wind, which would ultimately spell disaster for his car. Fortunately, Jamess first record attempt  which was delayed by rain  was successful, as he achieved a top speed of 152.5 km/h (94.76 mph) while completing the required 100-metre distance without any problems. However, James knew there was room for improvement. He said hed hardly touched the throttle and only gave it about 70% for just a few seconds. He knew it could go faster, but how much faster? Unfortunately, Jamess next two attempts at bettering the record didnt go to plan. On the second run, he achieved a speed of 220.7 km/h (137 mph), however, as the nose of the car fell off, this run was not eligible for the record. To officially achieve the record, the entire car must remain intact. After reviewing the footage, James realized that hed forgotten to bolt the nose onto the body of the car. The next day, James attempted a third run. Despite waiting until the afternoon for more favourable weather, there was an even stronger crosswind than the day before, which would ultimately be the downfall of Jamess car. During the third run, as the car zoomed ahead at unprecedented speeds, the wind swept it across the runway, destroying it.  This was truly the most heartbreaking crash Id ever experienced, James said. With the car travelling at a speed of 226.9 km/h (141 mph), a strong wind had pushed it to the side of the track, where it hit a recessed drain cover and was launched into the air. Upon landing, the car exploded, and the engine was damaged irreparably. Although the car was destroyed, it had still set a world record with the first run, thus James successfully achieved what he set out to do. James is now looking forward to his next project, which may again involve breaking a record. He could perhaps have a go at building the worlds fastest battery-powered remote-controlled car, a record that currently belongs to Nic Case (USA), who built the Radio Controlled Bullet, which achieved a speed of 325.12 km/h (202.02 mph) at the Rossa World Championships in 2014.

Deputy CM Tejashwi revealed he asked for an expressway for Bihar during the meeting with Nitin Gadkari.",https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1694650220997714137?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,,
Tata Motors cleared in 2 anti-trust violation cases by CCI,"Competition regulator CCI has cleared Tata Motors in two cases related to anti-trust violations. There was ""no sufficient material"" on record for commission to infer that Tata Motors' commercial vehicles' unit engaged in the violations, CCI said in its order. The complaints had alleged that Tata Motors ""coerced its authorised dealers to order vehicles according to its whims and fancies"".",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-540-11247761.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"#1. India makes history as Chandrayaan-3 lands near moons south pole India has created history by becoming the first country to land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole. The success of Chandrayaan-3 makes it only the fourth nation to achieve the milestone after the US, Russia, and China. The achievement by the Indian Space Research Agency was hailed across the world. The rover inside the lander has started moving on the lunar surface and begun scientific experiments. Why its important: India did not just land on the moon but did it flawlessly and in style. This will provide a huge boost to the domestic space industry known for its low-cost but cutting-edge outcomes. #2. Qatar Investment to buy nearly 1 percent stake in Reliance Retail for $1 billion Qatar Investment Authority will invest Rs 8,278 crore ($1 billion) into the retail business of Reliance Industries, which would be a new round of investments into Reliance Retail Ventures after Indias largest retailer raised Rs 47,265 crore in 2021. The fresh investment values Reliance Retail at Rs 8.28 lakh crore ($100 billion), twice its Rs 4.21 lakh crore valuation in 2021. Why its important: Investors are justifying the astronomical valuation due to the high growth potential of organized retail in India and the massive size of the domestic market. #3. Vegetable price inflation to ease after September, Reserve Bank governor says Vegetable prices in India have begun to soften and food inflation is likely to decline from September, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das has said. Annual retail inflation in July rose unexpectedly by 7.44 percent, its highest in 15 months, as vegetable and cereal price inflation skyrocketed to a 22-month high. Geopolitical tensions could hamper food price outlook but outlook for cereal prices is bright, Das said. Why its important: The Reserve Bank remains firm on containing inflation to its target of 4 percent, but volatile food prices, which are difficult to control through monetary policy, is jinxing its calculations. #4. Minister denies wrongdoing in Dwarka Expressway project after CAG flags cost overrun Refuting claims of cost overrun in building the Dwarka Expressway by the Comptroller and Auditor Generals, transport minister Nitin Gadkari has said that the project did not experience any cost overrun or corruption. However, ministry officials erred in not providing a written response to the findings by the governments auditor, he said. Why its important: The transport ministry must ensure that costs of vital infrastructure projects face less censure by boosting enhanced project transparency and professional governance. #5. India pushes for G20 unity on multilateral trade and investment India is hopeful that trade and investment ministers from the worlds 20 biggest economies set to meet in Jaipur on Thursday will be able to strike a consensus on key areas of trade and investment, although differences persist over the Ukraine war, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said. A meeting of finance leaders in February and G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in July failed to produce consensus communiques after Russia and China opposed any reference to the Ukraine conflict. Why its important: The G20 grouping must move beyond differences over the Ukraine conflict and agrees to work on issues around trade and investment. #6. Tata Communications plans to raise Rs 1,750 crore by issuing non-convertible debentures Tata Communications, part of the Tata Group, said in regulatory filings that it plans to raise Rs 1,750 crore by issuing non-convertible debentures. The deemed date of allotment of the debentures is August 29, which will mature after three years. The issuance will be done on a private placement basis to eligible investors and the firm will issue a total of 175,000 debentures of face value Rs 1 lakh each. Why its important: investors have cheered plans of Tata Communications to raise funds along with the expansion of its 5G services business. Its stock is now at a 52-week high. #7. Baring to sell 27 percent stake in Coforge worth Rs 7,400 crore through block deals Baring Private Equity Asia is set to sell up to 26.63 percent stake worth Rs 7,400 crore in Coforge, formerly known as NIIT Technologies, through block deals. Baring PE will exit the company through this sale. The floor price has been fixed at Rs 4,550 apiece. Coforge is valued at Rs 30,000 crore. Why its important: A return of 2.8x seems modest for Baring, which has recently made two big-ticket acquisitions in the country in HDFC Credila and Indira IVF. Deal activity has been rather muted recently. #8. Taxmen working on mechanism to reduce processing time for tax refunds to 10 days The central governments revenue department is working on a mechanism to cut the average period of processing and issuing tax refunds to 10 days from the current 16 days. The new timeline is expected to be enforced during this financial year to March. So far, refunds of Rs 72,215 crore have been issued from April 1 to August 21, which includes Rs 37,775 crore to companies and Rs 34,406 crore to individuals. Direct tax collection net of refunds stood at Rs 5.88 lakh crore. Why its important: India has made its tax processing more efficient in recent years. Processing refunds in 10 day from 26 in just two years ago is no mean achievement. #9. Jio, Vodafone India stick to stance on auctioning radio spectrum Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea have called for auctions as the default mechanism for assigning spectrum for broadcast and telecom applications, which was opposed by broadcast entities and other telecom operators. At an open house by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Bharti Airtel reiterated the need to regulate content tariff across distribution platforms so that the same content is not priced differently on different platforms. Why its important: The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation wants spectrum management for telecom and broadcast to be kept separate since the two services serve different purposes. The government will be the ultimate arbitrator. #10. Antitrust regulator clears Tata Motors of alleged anti-competitive practices The Competition Commission of India has cleared Tata Motors in two cases of anti-competitive practices in 2019 and 2020 in its commercial vehicles unit. There was no sufficient material on record for the commission to infer that Tata Motors engaged in anti-competitive practices, leading to an adverse effect on competition, the overseer said. Why its important: As competition intensifies in India, the regulator is seen to become proactive. The role of the antitrust overseer will increasingly become more important, and the government is working to strengthen it further.",

Chinas Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL) said its new lithium-ion battery would open up a new era for electric cars and eliminate range anxiety for owners.  On a full charge, the battery holds enough charge to travel over 700 km without needing to recharge  roughly 60 per cent further than the average electric vehicle in 2023. CATL said the increase in battery capacity and charge time was achieved through a brand-new superconducting electrolyte formula that results in improved conductivity. The future of the EV battery technology must remain steadfastly anchored at the global technology frontier, as well as the economic benefits, said Dr Wu Kai, chief scientist at CATL. As EV consumers shift from pioneering users to ordinary users, we should make advanced technology accessible for all and enable everyone to savour the fruits of innovation. CATL, which manufactured more lithium-ion batteries than any of its competitors in 2022, plans to begin mass production of its next-generation battery later this year. The company did not reveal which automakers would be the first to receive the batteries, though its customers include BMW, Daimler AG, Honda, Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Electric car sales have experienced record-breaking growth in recent years, with more than 10 million sold last year, however they still account for less than a fifth of all car sales. Range anxiety remains one of the main barriers for consumers when considering the purchase of an electric vehicle, according to the International Energy Agency, which has led manufacturers like CATL to invest heavily in overcoming this obstacle. Other challenges include access to battery materials and battery degradation, though CATL claims this second pain point is not an issue with its latest battery. Most major carmakers have set targets to phase out cars with internal combustion engines entirely by 2040 and estimates from the IEA suggest electric car sales will overtake fossil fuel-powered car sales within the next 15 years, though battery breakthroughs could reduce this time scale even further.

Tesla didn't fix Autopilot after 2016 crash that killed 1: Lawsuit,"Elon Musk-owned Tesla didn't make any changes to its Autopilot system following a crash in 2016 that killed a driver, the company's engineers said in a family's lawsuit over a similar 2019 collision. The changes were required to be made to account for crossing traffic. The lawsuit is the first against Tesla which blames the driver's death on Autopilot.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/tesla-failed-to-fix-autopilot-after-fatal-crash-engineers-say?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. failed to fix limitations in its Autopilot system following a gruesome Florida crash that killed a driver in 2016, company engineers said in a familys lawsuit over a very similar 2019 fatal collision thats headed to a jury trial. The electric-car maker didnt make any changes to its driver-assistance technology to account for crossing traffic in the nearly three years between two high-profile accidents that killed Tesla drivers whose cars slammed into the side of trucks, according to newly revealed testimony from multiple engineers. After years of touting autonomous driving as the way of the future, Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk are under legal pressure from consumers, investors, regulators and federal prosecutors who are questioning whether the company has over-hyped its progress toward self-driving vehicles during the last eight years. Tesla also is in the cross-hairs of multiple investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over possible defects in Autopilot linked to at least 17 deaths since June 2021. The trial set for October, the first for the company over a death blamed on Autopilot, will pit Musks repeated assertion that Teslas are the safest cars ever made against technology experts expected to testify that the companys marketing has lulled drivers into a false sense of security. Read More: Tesla Fatal-Crash Lawsuit to Test Musks Autopilot Claims Teslas attorneys representing the company didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. The automaker contends it has been transparent about Autopilots limitations, including challenges with detecting traffic crossing in front of its cars. Tesla warns in its owners manual and car screens that drivers must be alert and ready to take control of vehicles at any time. Tesla prevailed earlier this year in its first trial over a non-fatal Autopilot crash when a Los Angeles jury cleared the company of wrongdoing over a womans claim that the driver-assistance feature in her Model S caused her to veer into the center median of a city street. The case set to be presented to a jury in Palm Beach County, Florida, was brought by the family of Jeremy Banner, a 50-year-old father of three who had switched on Autopilot 10 seconds before his Model 3 plowed into the underbelly of a tractor-trailer in 2019. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Banner probably didnt see the truck crossing a two-lane highway on his way to work. Autopilot apparently didnt see it either. Despite the companys knowledge that theres cross traffic or potential for cross traffic, the Autopilot at the time was not designed to detect that, according to testimony given in 2021 by company engineer Chris Payne that was excerpted in a recent court filing. Engineer Nicklas Gustafsson provided a similar account in a 2021 deposition. Last week, Banners widow revised her complaint to seek punitive damages, raising the stakes for Tesla at trial. She argues the company should have re-programmed Autopilot so that it would shut off in dangerous circumstances after Tesla driver Joshua Brown crashed into the side of a truck in 2016. There is evidence in the record that the defendant Tesla engaged in intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence for selling a vehicle with an Autopilot system which Tesla knew to be defective and knew to have caused a prior fatal accident, the Banner family said in the amended complaint. Read More: Tesla Cant Perfect Autopilot Without a Few Deadly Crashes One of the expert witnesses retained by the Banner family brought is Mary Missy Cummings, who recently served as an adviser to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Cummings, a Duke University professor and vocal skeptic of Autopilot, said in a court filing that Tesla is guilty of intentional misconduct and gross negligence for failing to test and enhance Autopilot between the Brown and Banner crashes. Tesla made public statements that its Autopilot technology is far more capable than it actually is, Cummings wrote. Trey Lytal, a lawyer representing the Banner family, didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com 2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

FADA has requested for GST rate cut on entry-level two-wheelers, predominantly within the 100-125 cc segment. ""With two-wheelers accounting for over 75 per cent of the volume and over 70 per cent of this stemming from the entry-level category, it's imperative to address the over 20 per cent decline we've observed since pre-Covid times,"" FADA President Manish Raj Singhania said.

While several categories within the auto sector have displayed commendable recovery post the Covid-19 pandemic, the entry-level two-wheeler sector remains notably affected, he added. ""FADA believes that a GST revision would significantly alleviate the burden on potential buyers, especially in rural India, and catalyse the resurgence of this vital industry segment,"" Singhania said.

He added that while the Indian car industry may not ""grow in double digits, like...China in the past, we do expect...a 6% growth rate will be maintained till FY31"".",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/maruti-3-0-to-add-20-lakh-units-per-annum-capacity-in-9-yrs-28-models-by-fy31-says-rc-bhargava-11103871.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Maruti Suzuki India Chairman RC Bhargava revealed on August 7 'Maruti 3.0', a strategic endeavor focused on expanding its production capacity by an extra 20 lakh units over a span of nine years. According to him, this expansion plan also includes the release of about 28 different models by the end of the fiscal year 2031. In his address to the company's shareholders in the Annual Report for 20222023, he said that the company is currently revamping its manufacturing facilities to ""conform to the realities and what we are projecting for the future"" in light of the growing popularity of SUV sales in India. Bhargava added that although the Indian automobile sector is not anticipated ""to grow in double digits, like what happened in China in the past, we do expect that a 6 percent growth rate will be maintained till FY 2030-31"". Emphasising on the steps taken to fulfil anticipated demand, he said, Our first phase was when we were a public enterprise. The second phase ended with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Indian car market became the third largest in the world It took us 40 years to create a capacity of 2 million units and Suzuki Motor Corporation helped in this process by establishing the Gujarat facility. Your Company now has to add the next 2 million in a period of 9 years. By the fiscal year 203031, Maruti Suzuki projects export volumes of between 7.5 lakh and 8 lakh cars. The Chairman emphasised that the company has to increase its manufacturing capacity by an extra 20 lakh units due to the mix of home and foreign demand. Bhargava said, Our exports rose to 259,000 units last year. We expect the demand for exports to continue to grow and export volumes are projected at 750,000-800,000 cars by FY 2030-31. The task of managing the production of 40 lakh units annually, Bhargava added, may necessitate restructuring. He said, ""Requires considerable thought and possible reorganisation of the structure of the company keeping in view the best interests of all shareholders as well as other stakeholders of the company. We will, as soon as possible, announce what we are proposing"". He, however, said the challenge is not only to produce 40 lakh cars a year and possibly higher volumes in the subsequent years but the company also has to sell this number of cars. ""By FY 2030-31, your company could have about 28 different models. Clearly the organisation and systems for selling such a large variety of cars will require changes from what exists at present,"" he said. At present the company has 18 models sold in the market. ""Since there are no prospects of demand for the smaller entry level car market recovering to the growth rates of the past, we are restructuring our production facilities to conform to the realities and what we are projecting for the future,"" Bhargava said. He added that hatchbacks and small cars will still play a significant role in the company's overall portfolio despite the slump in this market. ""The rate of growth of these cars is expected to be less than 2 percent a year but the industry volume is almost a million cars a year with MSIL having a share of about 70 percent,"" he said, adding the company intends to do whatever is necessary to meet customer needs in this segment in the best possible manner. Maruti Suzuki has ""four very well-accepted SUVs in the market and are on our way to assume leadership in this segment. We will gradually keep increasing our market share that had declined in the last 2-3 years"", Bhargava said. On the growth prospects of the Indian car market, he said, ""While we do not expect the car industry to grow in double digits, like what happened in China in the past, we do expect that a 6 percent growth rate will be maintained till FY 2030-31."" In FY 2023-24, Bhargava said, Maruti Suzuki ""expects to grow at a slightly higher rate. Along with the rising domestic demand, the prospects for exports are also expected to continue to improve. Our exports rose to 2,59,000 units last year.""

Additionally, Maruti said its board has decided to exercise the option to acquire the shares of SMG from Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), subject to all legal and regulatory compliances including minority shareholders approval. Suzuki Motor Gujarat Private Limited (SMG) with its its registered office in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), which is a body corporate incorporated in Japan. The transaction shall be completed after taking all the Government approvals, as required, under Foreign Exchange Management Act, before March 31, 2024, Maruti SuzukiIndia said. The mode of acquisition including consideration to be paid to SMC shall be decided in a subsequent Board Meeting, it said. Presently, SMC holds 100 percent equity capital of SMG. Maruti Suzuki India in its statement said the turnover of the SMG in the last financial year ended on March 31, 2023 was Rs 318,525 million. RC Bhargava, Chairman of Maruti Suzuki India, said that Maruti Suzuki will take over EV production at the Gujarat site, replacing Suzuki Motor Corporation. He further stated that the acquisition of the facility is expected to be completed by the end of FY24. ""EV production at Gujarat facility will now be done by Maruti Suzuki instead of Suzuki Motor Corporation. Acquisition of Gujarat Plant will be completed by FY24 end,"" said RC Bhargava. The valuation of Suzuki's stake has not been determined yet, as it depends on the book value, RC Bhargava said, while adding that the battery plant will remain separate from this transaction, and also said though they are open to purchasing the battery plant from Suzuki, a final decision has not been made yet. ""We have not arrived at any valuation of Suzuki's stake, it depends on the book value. Suzuki's Battery plant will be independent of this transaction.

Maruti Suzuki aims for 4 million cars production per annum by 2030-31 Maruti Suzuki India stated that due to the growth in the Indian car market and potential for exports, they plan to increase their annual production capacity to about 4 million cars by 2030-31, nearly double the current levels. The expansion will happen in multiple locations, with some already identified and others still being studied. In response to the carbon neutrality requirements, Maruti Suzuki acknowledges that a mix of powertrain technologies, including EVs, Hybrids, CNG, Ethanol, etc., will coexist for a reasonably long period of time. However, managing the intricacies of production at such a large scale with multiple powertrains, under different managements, will present several challenges, according to Maruti. In terms of actual production, logistics, sales and the cost thereof, there will be no change as the cars earlier supplied by SMG as a contract manufacturer, will now continue to be supplied as before, it said. Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) on July 31 reported a 145.5 percent jump in its net profit at Rs. 2,485.1 crore during the first quarter of FY 2024.

Customers could be asked to return cancelled FAME subsidy: EV body,"Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles has written a letter to the Minister of Heavy Industries (MHI) after seven electric two-wheeler makers were asked to return ₹469 crore for violating the FAME-II scheme's norms. ""Since...the subsidies passed on to customers...now stand cancelled...the customers who've taken such subsidies can be asked to return these...in all fairness,"" the letter said.",https://www.bqprime.com/markets/ev-industry-lobby-says-fame-subsidy-be-recovered-from-customers?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles wrote a letter to the Minister of Heavy Industries on Friday, proposing that money demanded by the ministry for not complying with localisation norms be recovered from customers. ""Since the MHI is suggesting that the subsidies passed on to customers by OEMs now stand cancelleddue to technical reasons decided by the MHI Department subsequentlythe customers who have taken such subsidies can be asked to return these to OEMs in all fairness,"" it said in the letter. This relates to the subsidies the department has claimed back from the companies on a retrospective basis. The letter also referred to Rs 1,200 crore that the manufacturers claim remains unreimbursed. The retrospective recovery includes the subsidies that companies claimed before the issue of non-compliance with localisation norms came to the fore. After the companies were frozen out of the subsidies, they carried on providing benefits to the customers, hoping they would continue after the investigation was concluded. The ministry had stopped subsidy disbursals to several companies amid allegations of misappropriation of funds under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India Scheme. The complaints were mainly related to the violation of phased manufacturing programme guidelines under the FAME India Scheme Phase II, which lays guidelines for using locally sourced parts in manufacturing electric vehicles. Under the scheme, companies could claim a subsidy of Rs 15,000 per kWh for two-wheelers, with an upper limit of 40% of the vehicle's cost, which should not go beyond Rs 1.5 lakh. Later, the subsidy was reduced to Rs 10,000 per kWh of battery capacity, while the overall incentives were capped at 15% of the vehicle's ex-showroom price. The letter to the ministry comes from former Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sanjay Kaul, who was onboarded as the chief evangelist at the association, to help revise the agenda. The association has been at loggerheads with the Heavy Industries Ministry over issues related to withholding of subsidies, denying listing of new models for benefits, and demanding retrospective recovery of subsidies. The letter equated the situation to the one where a few companies had to return money to customers after charging them separately for EV chargers. Considering the penalty on some companies for overcharging the customers, it is possible that the monies the ministry is currently demanding from the other set of OEMs for non-compliance can be similarly recovered by them from the customers and returned to the department, it said. ""If a customer has received a discount over and above the correct price, it is incumbent on him or her to return the excess, even if the correction comes retrospectively,"" Kaul wrote in the letter.",

The matter came up before the AAR when a power distribution company wanted to set up various public charging stations for charging EVs. The company said that it intended to charge tax and collect an electric vehicle charging fee, which would include two componentsenergy charges and service charges. Energy charge refers to the number of units of energy consumed. The primary issue that arose was whether the energy charges would be treated as a supply of goods or a supply of services, and if the former, whether the company could claim exemption under GST as the supply of electricitywhich is treated as a supply of goodsis exempt under the Act. Therefore, the question before the ruling authority was whether EV charging would be included under the category of supply of electricity or not. The AAR said that the activity of charging an EV involves charging a battery, i.e., the conversion of electric energy to chemical energy. Electricity, which is a moveable property and classified as a good, is not supplied to the consumer as such but is converted into chemical energy, which is received by the consumer in the EV battery, it said. While clarifying its stance, the AAR also referred to a clarification issued by the Ministry of Power, which said that charging an EV does not in any way include the sale of electricity to any person as the electricity is consumed within the premises owned by the charging station, which may be connected to the distribution system for receiving electricity. The ruling authority held that the activity of charging an EV is not a supply of electricity or a supply of any moveable property, but a supply of service. It ruled that supply of electrical energy and service charges together are to be treated as supply of service and would attract a GST rate of 18%. It also said that the company will be entitled to set off its tax liabilities against its input tax credits.",

The Eastern District Court of Michigan on July 19 ruled that Mahindra Automotive North America can keep producing, selling and distributing the post-2020 version of Roxor, the Mumbai-based company said in an exchange filing late Thursday. The court denied Fiats request to apply the safe distance rule on Roxor. The legal spat began after Fiat complained Roxor is a nearly identical copy of the Jeep, with some design elements such as boxy body shape with flat-appearing vertical sides and rear body ending at about the same height as the hood. In June 2020, the International Trade Commission said that while the Roxor doesnt violate Fiats trademarks, it infringes the trade dress  a products look that distinguishes its source to consumers  and recommended prohibiting the import and sale of Roxor parts, according to the filing. Mahindra contended that Roxors 2018 and 2019 models  subject to the legal action  were no longer in production and the 2020 version had a fresh look with further design changes planned. In December that year, the ITC said that the post-2020 Roxor doesnt infringe on the Jeep trade dress, modifying its previous order to exempt the redesigned Roxor from an import ban.

Tesla shared the development on its Twitter account, posting a photo of workers in vests and helmets gathered around the vehicle. When Musk first showed a prototype of the wedge-shaped pickup in November 2019, the plan was for production to start two years later. Musk has tempered expectations for how quickly Tesla will ramp up production, saying during the companys annual meeting in May that the trucks radical design poses challenges. Hes said the body of the pickup will be stainless steel, which can be expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Well make as many as people want and can afford, Musk said. Its going to be hard to make the cost affordable because it is a new car, new manufacturing method. So in the grand scheme of things, relative to the production rate of all the other cars we make, it will be small. But its still very cool.

Among other things, the app will provide the location and the capacity of these stations, a senior government official told Moneycontrol. The development of the app and its launch is being led by NITI Aayog. Charging point operators and equipment manufacturers have all come on board to share the required information with the app, the official said. Due to a lack of interoperability, currently, a person with a particular brand of EV has a view of charging stations pertaining to only that specific make / model. Integrated solution Right now, if you have a Tata electric car, then the charging infrastructure of Tata will be visible to you. But on the new app, MG, Mercedes, EESL, etc., all the charging infrastructure will be visible. This will be available in two months, he said. Initially, the app will show information like charging station location, connectors, whether the charging station is operational, its capacity, etc. Alternating current electric. vehicle connectors deliver power from a charging station to the onboard charger of an electric car. The onboard charger converts alternating current to direct current and then feeds it to the electric vehicles battery pack. It will also show battery swapping stations and fast and slow chargers. The app will mention whether the charging station is open (o), or captive (c), or semi-public (sp). A charging station exclusively for the electric vehicles owned or under the control of the owner of the charging station like fleet owners is called captive. Semi-public charging stations are installed on private land but open to public use like visitor parking. Open or public charging stations are found street-side, at retail shopping centres, government facilities and parking areas. Later, the government intends to include features like booking and payment in the application"", the official added. Currently, there are over 7,000 public charging stations.

Nissan's ex-CEO Carlos Ghosn sues automaker for $1 bn over ouster,"Nissan's former CEO Carlos Ghosn has filed a $1-billion lawsuit against the Japanese automaker and connected individuals for ousting him in 2018 and arranging his arrest over alleged financial misconduct. Ghosn filed the lawsuit in Lebanon, where he has lived since escaping from Japan in 2019 to flee trial. In 2020, Nissan sued Ghosn for $90 million in monetary damages.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/carlos-ghosn-sues-nissan-for-1-billion-in-damages-over-ouster-10826181.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Carlos Ghosn, the former head of Nissan Motor Co., sued the Japanese automaker and connected individuals for ousting him in 2018 and arranging his arrest for alleged financial misconduct, claiming more than $1 billion for deep damage to his finances and reputation. The former auto executive, who forged Nissans carmaking alliance with Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., filed his claims with the public prosecutor in the Court of Cassation in Lebanon, where he has lived since his dramatic escape from Japan in late 2019 to flee trial. The lawsuit, seen by Bloomberg News, was submitted on May 18 and translated into English from Arabic. The arrest of Ghosn, 69, sent shockwaves through the global auto industry and unleashedturmoilwithin Nissan that continues to this day. Ghosn has minced few words criticizing Nissan and Japans legal authorities for removing him from the worlds biggest automaking alliance. He still faces criminal charges in Japan for what prosecutors describe as a plot to underreport his compensation, as well as acivil lawsuitfiled by Nissan in a court in Yokohama seeking monetary damages. The serious and sensitive accusations against me will linger in peoples minds for years, Ghosn asserted in the lawsuit, saying he will suffer from them for the remainder of his life, as they have persistent and lingering impacts, even if based on mere suspicion. The lawsuit claims $588 million in lost compensation and costs, as well as $500 million in punitive measures. Nissans shareholders also suffered losses after the company squandered itsfirst-mover advantagewith respect to electric vehicles. Ghosn isno longera shareholder in the Japanese company. Ghosn was sent by Renault in 1999 to turn around the Japanese carmaker, which had been struggling before receiving a cash injection from the French company. He later became chief executive officer of both companies and chairman of the alliance. The lawsuit also makes claims against at least a dozen people, including: Hari Nada, a Nissan employee seen as one of the keyinstigatorsof the plot to oust GhosnHidetoshi Imazu and Hitoshi Kawaguchi, two senior Nissan managers withearly involvementin Nissans actions against GhosnToshiaki Onuma, a manager in the CEOs office, who along with Nada, agreed to cooperate with Japanese prosecutors to avoid prosecutionMasakazu Toyoda and Motoo Nagai, two Nissan board membersA representative for Nissan said the company hasnt yet received the lawsuit or is aware of it, and therefore cant comment or make anyone available for comment on Ghosns claims. The lawsuit includes other individuals and entities, which have not yet been served, according to Ghosns legal representative. Lebanons public prosecutor has set a hearing for September. Authorities in Lebanon can request cooperation from their Japanese counterparts to investigate Ghosns assertions. Its not clear whether Japans judicial system, which Ghosn has said is rigged and violates the most basic principles of humanity, would be willing to cooperate with authorities in Lebanon, which doesnt extradite its citizens. In 2020, a UN panel found that Ghosns detention in a Japanese jail for more than 100 days was neither necessary nor reasonable and violated his rights. The decision to arrest Ghosn four times in a row so as to extend his detention was fundamentally unfair, according to the United Nations Human Rights Councils Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The 18-page claim includes Ghosns plan to bring Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors under a grand alliance with Fiat Chrysler, which he says fueled concerns within Nissan in early 2018 that he was seeking to make the partnership irreversible. Nada and others then laid the groundwork to have Ghosn arrested in order to remove him from Nissan and the alliance, according to the former auto executive. Ghosn also described his intentions for taking a voluntary pay cut in 2011 after new disclosure rules in Japan triggered efforts to find legal means to retain and pay him during retirement. Those plans eventually became the basis for the arrest of Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a former Nissan director who was involved in the salary discussions. A trial verdict last year exonerated Kelly of most charges and imposed a fine on Nissan. The former auto executive described how he received job offers by Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and a more lucrative salary to join General Motors Co., but decided to stay with the alliance following the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Ghosn said the efforts within Nissan to find ways to compensate and keep him were criminalized because that was the only means found by the conspirators to get rid of him as the chairman of the board of directors. Nada and others then waged a defamation campaign to tarnish his image, Ghosn asserts in the lawsuit. The claim also details the involvement of the Japanese and French governments, the purge of certain people from Nissan following Ghosns arrest, issues with the companys internal investigation into the matter and damage done to shareholders as a result of the actions. In a way, the lawsuit is the crystallization of Ghosns efforts to clear his name following his arrival in Lebanon, where in early 2020 he held anepic news conferencedenouncing his arrest. The former auto executive spent part of his childhood in the country and lives in a house that was bought and restored by Nissan, which he had planned to buy from the company upon retirement. They cannot plot a lie and cheat and get away with it, Ghosn said by telephone from Beirut. This is just a small response to the damage they created. I dont think they can right the wrong, because the damage is so deep  this is intended to repair part of the damage that has been done.",

Listed public sector companies to pay government record Rs 63,000 crore dividend The government is expected to net an all-time high equity dividend of Rs 63,056 crore from 67 listed public-sector undertakings for 2022-23, based on final dividends proposed by these companies for the year ended March. The amount is 24.7 percent higher than the dividend of Rs 50,583 crore thegovernment garnered in 2021-22. The amount could rise further since because a few such as Gail (India), Hindustan Copper, and Balmer Lawrie are yet to declare dividend. Why its important: The record dividend from listed state-owned will provide the government additional dry powder to upscale public expenditure in an election year without widening the fiscal deficit. #2. Key local market gauge indicates interest rates may stay high for longer The rates for overnight indexed swaps, a key indicator of how the Reserve Bank of India may act on policy rates, have climbed over the past eight days, reversing earlier optimism that rates were likely to head lower in the last quarter of 2023. The reset in domestic interest rate expectations have beendriven are policy statements by the Indian central bank and the US Federal Reserve on June 8 and 14, in which both flagged concerns over persistent inflation. Why its important: The important market gauge is now penciling in a reduction in the cost of borrowing funds only in April next year. Inflation is simply not cooling fast enough to warrant an immediate easing of monetary policy in the near term. #3. Exports decline for fourth straight month; trade deficit widens to five-month high Indias merchandise exports in May contracted for a fourth straight month as external demand remained slack on a slowdown in its key markets, commerce ministry data showed. Outbound shipments declined 10.31 percent on year to $34.98 billion, and imports fell 6.59 per cent to $57.10 billion. External trade contracted for a fifth consecutive month amid cooling commodity prices and Indias policy to substitute inbound shipments. It led to the trade deficit widening to a five-month highof $22.12 billion in May. Why its important: The headwind to Indias external trade is expected to continue due to an economic slowdown in the key markets in the West and elsewhere. #4. Singapore Airlines may gradually raise its stake in Air India to 40 percent Singapore Airlines may gradually raise its stake in Air India from the current 25.1 percent to about 40percent. The carrier and the Tata group have held initial talks regarding the potential increase in stake in response to a request from the Singapore-based airline. The proposal is still at an earlystage. Why its important: Air India would welcome such a move as it seeks to take on domestic market leader IndiGo and compete with other global carriers popular with Indians for overseas travel. #5. iPhone maker Foxconn may build an electric vehicle factory in Indian in 2023 Foxconn is looking to enter the electric vehicle manufacturing sector in India. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer has been in talks with some state governments to further its plans. Foxconn has said in its annual report that India will assist with the establishment of a production line this year to provide two-wheeled electric vehicle manufacturing services that will cater to the market in Southeast Asia. Why its important: It is the first time Foxconn has articulated its ambitions of manufacturing electric two-wheelers in India on the back of a rapidly growing market in the country and southeast Asia. #6. Transamerica cancels $2 billion contract with TCS to focus on insourcing IT services Tata Consultancy Services $2 billion, 10-year deal with US arm of Dutch insurer Aegon has been scrapped five-and-a-half years after Transamerica Life Insurance company selected Indias largest IT services company. Transamerica plans to cut its dependence on third-party IT services firms such as TCS, choosing to do much of the IT work on its own. Why its important: Losing a marquee client would be seen as a setback although the financial impact will be minimal as TCS will have concluded about eight years of the contract period before its ends prematurely. #7. Reliance Industries to raise $2 billion in dollar loans to fund business expansion Reliance Industries is in talks with lenders for a foreign currency loan of up to $2 billion to fund the ongoing expansion of its oil to telecom business. The firm controlled by Mukesh Ambani intends to use Indias dedicated external commercial borrowing route to secure the loan. The facility may have a maturity period ranging between three to five years and the proceeds will be used for capital expenditure and to refinance a loan that matures in September. Why its important: Reliances recent activity towards expansion of its various businesses has been driven by huge borrowings after the conglomerate achieved net debt zero status in 2020. It is in astrong position to secure loans at favorable terms. #8. Two-wheeler demand in rural market sees resurgence after a few years Demand for motorcycles and scooters has remained weak in the Past few years amid a rise in acquisition costs and the economic impact of the pandemic. It has now started picking up, propelled by a turnaround in consumer sentiment in rural markets, industry executives said. The sector expect sales to grow in double digits in the current financial year, largely driven by pent-up demand in rural areas that account for about 55 percent of two-wheeler sales in the country. Why its important: Better farm output, an increase in the minimum support price for the autumn harvest announced last week and state spending on rural development are expected will help increase disposable incomes in rural areas, leading to a spurt in demand. #9. Willful defaulters in India to get loans only after five years of settlement Indias banks will be allowed to provide loans to willful borrowers and defaulters after five years of a compromise settlement. Debt restructuring will be allowed only if there is a change in promoters. The Reserve Bank of India had issued circular on compromise settlement with borrowers, including willful defaulters and accounts. Why its important: The move by the central bank will make defaulting on loans ore expensive in terms of opportunity cost for borrowing firms, compelling them to work harder to service loans regularly. #10. Market leader IndiGo improves share after Go First halted operations IndiGo has registered its highest ever domestic market share of 61.4 percent in May, capitalising on Go First suspending flights. Domestic airlines flew a record 13.2 million passengers in May, improving on the December 2019 figure of 13.01 million.

Four states breach 10% adoption of electric two-wheelers: Report,"Four states have breached the 10% mark in electric two-wheeler (e2W) penetration, Business Standard reported citing Vahan Dashboard data. Goa led the way (17.2%), followed by Kerala (13.66%), Karnataka (12.19%) and Maharashtra (10.74%), which is the largest state in terms of the number of e2Ws sold. Overall, India reached an e2W penetration of 5.63% as of May 31.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-487-10768241.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"#1. Reserve Bank holds rates for second straight time, to closely watch inflation The monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of India has kept policy rates unchanged for the second consecutive time. The decision to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent was unanimous. A majority of the members said a status quo on policy stance will ensure that inflation progressively comes down to the 4 percent target while supporting growth. Why its important: The pause in raising rates was mainly because inflation cooled more than expected and the central bank believes backing growth is necessary given the risks of a weak monsoon. #2. Monsoon finally arrives in Kerala, to advance over mainland in next 48 hours Kerala has finally seen the first showers of the southwest monsoon a week behind schedule, with its predicted advance over the mainland raising confidence about rural incomes and economic growth. The June-to-September monsoon, vital for irrigating 45 percent of cultivated land, is set to progress over more of peninsular India and the northeast over the next 48 hours, the India Meteorological Department said. Why its important: The monsoons progress is keenly watched by both farmers and policymakers because it has an oversized impact on Indias rural economy and incomes. The El Nino phenomenon that leads to reduced rainfall continues to pose a worry. #3. Indians have so far returned half of Rs 2,000 banknotes in circulation Residents of India have so far returned around half of the Rs 2,000 notes in circulation, with 85 percent deposited in banks and the remaining exchanged by customers. On 19 May, the Reserve Bank had announced the withdrawal of the high-value notes from circulation, giving people until September 30 to deposit or exchange them. The total value of these notes in circulation was Rs 3.62 lakh crore or 10.8 percent of notes in circulation on March 31. Why its important: The move to withdraw the Rs 2,000 banknotes in circulation is expected to increase liquidity, at least temporarily, and lead to a surge in bank deposits. #4. Some 24 global brands to mark Indian entry through stores this year About two dozen international brands, including Italian luxury fashion brand Roberto Cavalli, British luxury goods brand Dunhill, American sportswear and footwear retailer Foot Locker are in talks to enter India with their stores this year. Chains such as Lavazza and Armani Caffe of Italy, Jamba of the US and the Coffee Club from Australia are also likely to enter India this year. This is up from one global brand in 2020, three in 2021 and 11 in 2022. Before the pandemic, about 12-15 brands used to enter India every year. Why its important: The entry of global brands will be the highest in at least a decade. They seem to be encouraged by a post pandemic surge in consumption among the well-off in the country. #5. Stressed margins remain chokepoint for FMCG supply chain companies Jiomart B2B has become the latest among organized supply chain companies to bite the bullet, shutting down warehouses and asking employees to leave. Companies are finding it hard to sustain the supply chain business primarily because gross margins in supplying FMCGs products are very low. While it looks attractive because its the largest part of the consumption market, the last-mile supply chain and retailer are not making money, experts said. Why its important: The cost of supply chains is disproportionately high in rural market due to lower volumes. A demand resurgence could lead to better numbers and destress warehousing and supply. #6. Four states race past 10 percent adoption of electric two-wheelers Four Indian states have breached the 10 percent mark in electric two-wheeler penetration, according to latest Vahan Dashboard data. Goa leads the way with 17.20 percent, although with modest numbers, followed by Kerala (13.66 percent) and Karnataka (12.19 percent). Maharashtra, with an adoption rate of 10.74 percent, is the largest state in the number of electric two-wheelers sold. In 2019, no state had more than 1 percent penetration. Why its important: It is widely believed that the domestic market for electric two-wheelers may have breached an inflexion point. The recent removal of significant subsidies could slam the brakes on that. #7. Legal battle with lenders in the US may stymie fundraising efforts by Byjus The legal battle between Byjus and US lenders on the edtech unicorns $1.2 billion term loan is expected to adversely affect its fund raising, including debt, loan, and equity, industry experts said. It might also delay the IPO for its tutoring service subsidiary Aakash Educational Services, which is eyeing a public listing next year. Byjus has filed a suit against US-based investment management firm Redwood, challenging the acceleration of the term loan facility and to disqualify the lender for its tactics. Why its important: Byjus missed a quarterly interest payment of about $40 million on the $1.2 billion loan, becoming the only Indian start-up to have defaulted on dollar borrowings. It would now find it harder to raise further funds from overseas investors. #8. Tribunal accepts Delhiverys notice wanting to declare Go Firsts insolvency filing as fraudulent The National Company Law Tribunal has accepted Delhiverys notice seeking declaration of Go Firsts voluntary insolvency resolution as fraudulent and malicious. It gave the interim resolution professional of the Wadia-group airline two weeks to reply. Under Section 65 of the bankruptcy code, fraudulent and malicious initiation of insolvency proceedings can invite a penalty of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Why its important: Delhivery has argued that Go First received Rs 57 lakh on May 2 from the logistics firm as advance for future services despite knowing it would soon file for insolvency. Bankruptcy proceedings halt all assert and fund recovery till a resolution plan is approved. #9. Lenders to Reliance Capital to vote on resolution plan submitted by Hinduja Group The creditors of Reliance Capital will start voting on Friday on the resolution plan submitted by a Hinduja Group entity that offers recovery of Rs 10,000 crore. The Groups IndusInd International Holdings submitted a detailed resolution plan earlier this week, which was presented to lenders on Wednesday. Torrent Investments, Piramal Capital and Oaktree Capital, the other bidders in the fray, did not submit detailed plans within the deadline. Why its important: The expected recovery from the sale of Reliance Capital at Rs 10,090 crore would be below the liquidation value pegged at Rs 12,500-13,000 crore, implying a recovery of 43 percent. #10. Peak XV Partners, spilt from Sequoia Capital, has dry powder worth $2.5 billion As part of the $2.85 billion funds raised for India and Southeast Asia in 2022, Peak XV Partners have $2.5 billion of uninvested dry powder, managing director Shaliendra Singh has said. All the capital raised for India and Southeast Asia as well as Sequoias portfolio of 400 plus companies remains, he said. We are very bullish on India and Southeast Asia as a market and we are going to only double down, he said. Why its important: Indias start-up ecosystem has gone into a tizzy as the marquee Sequoia Capital, which has invested in numerous enterprises in the country, spun-off its India unit in a retreat from Asia.",

Electric 2-wheelers get costlier as govt slashes FAME subsidy,"Prices of several electric two-wheelers have gone up after the government slashed the subsidy under the FAME-II scheme on June 1. Bajaj Auto, the maker of the Chetak electric scooter, said it has raised prices by ₹22,000, while Ather Energy has increased prices by ₹10,000, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Electric 2-wheeler sales cross 1-lakh mark in May for the 1st time,"The domestic electric two-wheeler industry's monthly sales crossed the one-lakh mark for the first time in May as the announcement of a subsidy cut on such vehicle purchases led to a buying rush. On a year-on-year basis, electric two-wheeler registrations were up by 147% from 42,415 units sold in May 2022. In April, the numbers had declined by nearly 23%.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/electric-two-wheeler-sales-cross-1-lakh-mark-in-may-as-subsidy-cut-sparks-buying-rush-10732141.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The domestic electric two-wheeler (E2W) industry saw monthly sales cross the one lakh mark for the first time in May as the announcement of a subsidy cut on such vehicle purchases sparked a last-minute buying rush. As per the data available on the government portal Vahan, retail monthly sales of electric two-wheelers scaled a new high of 104,845 units in May 2023, which is about 57 percent higher than the 66,727 units registered in April 2023. See table below:  On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, E2W registrations were up by 147 percent percent from 42,415 units sold in May 2022. According to industry players, the record numbers were largely due to buyers advancing purchases in the last 10 days of May as E2W manufacturers indicated that there will be a price mark-up post the subsidy cut. Anticipating a 15-20 percent price hike in June, buyers booked vehicles at lower prices with a larger FAME-II subsidy. In April,the numbers had declined by nearly 23 percent over issues related to delays in subsidy disbursement and supply shortage. It is to be mentioned that Vahan only records the total number of vehicles which have been registered (post-sales) and doesnt include booked ones. It also doesnt take into account low-speed E2W sales and excludes data for Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, which means the sales in May must be higher. The subsidy cut On May 21, the government notified that the subsidy on the FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India) Scheme will be revised to Rs 10,000 per kilowatt per hour (kWh) as against Rs 15,000/ kWH starting June 1. (l) Furthermore, the cap for incentive has been brought down to 15 percent of the ex-factory price of the model as against 40 percent offered earlier. The May 2023 numbers top the previous best of 86,269 units logged in March 2023by 19,303 units, as per the data available on Vahan. The total numbers of E2Ws registered were 64,664 units in January and 66,057 units in February. OEMs shatter records The record sales were largely underpinned by the all-time high monthly volumes of the top three OEMs  Ola Electric, TVS Motor Co and Ather Energy. Ola Electric continued to maintain the leading position as it sold 28,469 units of e-scooters in May 2023, which is nearly 30 percent higher than the 21,991 units sold amonth before, as per Vahan data. In a statement, the company claimed that it has sold over 35,000 units in May, capturing a market share of over 30 percent, posting a YoY growth of 300 percent. Bhavish Aggarwal, Founder and CEO, Ola Electric, said, Month after month, our sales have experienced exponential growth and Ola has consistently led the EV revolution in India. TVS Motor Company, which crossed 20,000 units of monthly sales for the first time, was in the second spot. The company sold 20,262 units of iQube, surpassing its previous best of 17,878 units in March 2023 and recording a 131 percent MoM growth over 8,751 units sold in April 2023. TVS iQube has a healthy booking pipeline of over 30,000 units and we are confident of continued improvement of supplies in the coming months, the company said in a statement. Ather Energy, which reached the third spot, also hit a new monthly high in May 2023. At 15,266 units, its sales in May were nearly 100 percent more than Aprils 7,786 units. In a statement, the company claimed it grew by 357 percent on a YoY basis. Ravneet Singh Phokela, Chief Business Officer of Ather Energy, said, ""The market gained strong momentum this month, which can be attributed to the growing underlying demand, fuelled further by the news of the impending revision of the FAME subsidy. This led to some consumers bringing forward their purchases, in order to avail the higher subsidy amount. We hope to maintain this momentum as the manufacturing industry and its ecosystem continue to grow. While Bajaj Auto rose to fourth place for the first time with a 168 percent month-on-month increase in sales to 9,931 units, Ampere Vehicles took fifth position with 9,632 units, up 15 percent over Aprils 8,324 units. Price hikes implemented With reduced FAME II subsidy reduced, OEMs like Ola, Ather, TVS, etc., have already jacked up the prices of e-scooters and e-motorcycles by 10 percent to 15 percent. Industry analysts reckon that there will be some near-term impact on sales in the next few months but the market is expected to bounce back during the onset of the festive season. Furthermore, new launches like Ola S1 Air, Ather 450S, TVS iQube ST, a new variant of Bajaj Chetak, etc., may prop up some volumes, as indicated by companies.",

The ruling Communist Party is trying to revive investor interest in Chinas slowing economy and reassure companies that have been rattled by anti-monopoly and data-security crackdowns, raids on consulting firms, tension with Washington and pressure to align their plans with official development goals. The commerce minister, Wang Wentao, said Beijing will support long-term, stable development of foreign-invested enterprises in China,"" according to a ministry statement. Musk praised the potential of China's development and expressed willingness to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, the statement said. The United States and China should strengthen economic and trade dialogue and cooperation under the guidance of principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, Wang was cited as saying. Earlier, Musk met with the industry minister, Jin Zhuanglong, and exchanged views on the development of new energy vehicles and intelligent networked vehicles, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said on its website. China accounts for half of global electric vehicle sales and is the site of Teslas first factory outside the United States. Li, the premier, delivered a similar message of reassurance in meetings in March with CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Albert Bourla of Pfizer, Jakob Stausholm of Rio Tinto and Toshiaki Higashihara of Hitachi. Tesla opened the first wholly foreign-owned auto factory in China in 2019 after Beijing eased ownership restrictions to increase competition and speed up industry development. Tesla didnt respond to requests by email for information about Musks visit to China. Musk also is the majority owner of social media platform Twitter, access to which is blocked in China by the ruling party's internet filters.",

It did not share further details. Tesla representatives did not respond to AFP requests for further information on Musk's itinerary. Musk arrived in Beijing Tuesday on his first trip to China in more than three years. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market and Tesla announced in April it would build a second massive factory in Shanghai. That factory will be Tesla's second plant in Shanghai after Gigafactory, which broke ground in 2019. In a meeting with Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang on Tuesday, Musk said he was ""willing to continue to expand its business in China"", according to a foreign ministry readout. He also expressed his opposition to an economic ""decoupling"" between China and the United States, Beijing said. Musk's extensive business ties to China have raised eyebrows in Washington, with President Joe Biden saying in November that the executive's links to foreign countries were ""worthy"" of scrutiny. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Tuesday that the country welcomed visits by international executives ""to better understand China and promote mutually beneficial cooperation"".",

Yes! You read it right. After taking the Automotive Testing Papenburg (ATP) facility in Germany, the all-electric Nevera achieved the 0-100kph speed in just 1.81 seconds, which is 0.05sec quicker than the faster car named Pininfarina Battista as it was holding the title for sprinting same speed in 1.86 seconds.   If you are wondering that is it. Then hold your horses. The EV also set another record by sprinting 0-400kph in just 29.93 seconds. After this, the vehicle broke the world record that was set by Koenigsegg Regera in 2019 when it achieved the fastest acceleration in the same category in just 31 seconds.   In order to record or document the iconic scene created by Rimac Nevera, the two independent verifiers by a third-party firm named Dewesoft and RaceLogic were also present at the occasion. They organised multiple sets of rounds by the Nevera at the ground,including standing quarter mile time. After the activity was completed and the results came out, verifiers gave the Rimac Nevera the title of the fastest and most powerful EV ever made. All speed records were completed using road-legal Michelin Cup 2 R tires on the ground. Meanwhile, Rimac says that the Nevera smashed existing records by running repeatedly at full throttle conditions without a single reliability issue or significant loss of performance. The brand also claimed that the EV is powered by four separate surface-mounted permanent-magnet electric motors that provide a combined 1,914 horsepower and a whopping 2,360 Nm peak torque at a stated top speed of 412 km/h.

BS-7 complaint automobiles will be prepared on the lines of proposed Euro-7 emissions standards. The European Commission has proposed to roll out the Euro-7 norm from July 2025 for new cars and vans, and July 2027 for new trucks and buses. Sources said the road transport ministry has started initial work for the BS-7 emission standard. Speaking about the same at the apex technical committee on vehicle standards (CMVR-TSC) meeting, Gadkari said that the automakers in India now should start their own research and keep a focus on making vehicles as per BS-7 norms. He said this time the industries have to take the initiative on their own. They should not wait for deadlines from the government, which already happened at the time of the BS-6 transition. Indian auto industry should also go parallel to European counterparts, the minister added. Gadkari's comments come after days of the European Commission declaring that it will start implementing Euro-7 emission norms by July 2025 for new cars and vans. Later, in 2027, the same will be implemented for new trucks and buses. To export their goods to European nations and to reduce local vehicular pollution, the auto industry in India also will have to follow the transition from the present BS-6 to BS-7. Meanwhile, some reports say that leading car manufacturers such as Toyota and Honda already started working on a plan to minimise vehicular pollution.

Speaking to Faber, Musk said that he wanted every one concerned to slowdown the development of AI for a very good reason - human survival. On his role in the AI company, Musk told CNBC, ""I am the reason OpenAI exists"". Regarding AI, Faber started by bringing up the fear expressed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during a Senate sub-committee meeting regarding this new technology. Musk quickly added that, ""It is a significant area of concern...."" Faber thereafter asked Musk about what chances did he give AI of destroying humanity. Musk replied by calling it a ""double-edged sword,"" that it could do great damage. He explained that AI may end up doing a lot of good for humanity, that it may even usher in the ""age of abundance"", but there is also a chance that it may cause massive damage. Musk said, ""And theres some chance that it goes wrong and destroys humanity. Hopefully that chance is small, but its not zero."" Musk has famously signed a petition for all work on AI to be paused.

He and his family, including a four-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter, miraculously survived the fall off Devils Slide, a dangerous and rocky area known for its fatal car wrecks. Patel, 41, told investigators that while the Indian-origin family was driving on the Pacific Coast Highway, the sensor in his white Tesla Model Y indicated that the tyre pressure was low, New York Post reported, quoting documents. The car, he claimed, fell off the ocean-facing cliff when he tried to stop the car and check the tyres. His wife, Neha, however, refuted this claim and said Dharmesh Patel was suffering from depression and drove off the cliff intentionally. He drove off. Hes depressed. Hes a doctor. He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off, Neha Patel told the police on the day of the incident while she was being flown in a helicopter after being rescued from the crash site, San Francisco Chronicle reported.

She then told him that her husband needs a psych evaluation. She said that suspect Patel drove them off and repeated this multiple times, the officer reportedly wrote, adding that another rescue worker heard her say that Patel drove off the cliff on purpose and tried to kill everyone.

A group of senior executives from Tesla Inc. is planning to visit Indiaon Wednesday and Thursday. C-suite executives and managers from Austin, Texas-based Teslas supply chain, are expected to be among the visitors. The purpose of the visit is to engage with federal government officials and explore opportunities to enhance the carmaker's supply chain in the country as it seeks to expand beyond China. According to the report, the executives are expected to restate Tesla's demand that India reduce import duties on its cars. The executives are scheduled to hold meetings with government representatives, including officials from the office of prime minister Narendra Modi. The discussions will revolve around the possibility of local sourcing of components for Tesla's car models. The sources have requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the plans. This visit could mark a significant turning point in the relationship between India and Tesla, as the electric vehicle manufacturer is yet to establish a notable presence in the country. By engaging with Indian authorities, Tesla aims to pave the way for potential future operations in one of the world's largest automobile markets. India has been actively promoting the adoption of electric vehicles to combat air pollution and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. With the Indian government's push towards electric mobility, Tesla's entry into the market could offer an attractive proposition for both parties. Expanding its supply chain in India would not only allow Tesla to diversify its operations away from China but also align with the Indian government's ""Make in India"" initiative, which encourages domestic manufacturing and sourcing. The Tesla executives' visit comes as welcome news after Elon Musk had halted Tesla's plans to enter the Indian market last year after a prolonged standoff with the Indian government over reduced tariffs. As PM Modi works to establish India as a global manufacturing hub, sourcing more products from here could help Tesla win the Indian government's support. The PM Modi administration has so far had a lukewarm relationship with Tesla and had stated there is ""no problem"" if the automobile company is ready to manufacture electric vehicles in India, but the it must not import automobiles from China., Also read: India welcomes Tesla and other EV investments as long as the vehicles are made in India: Nitin Gadkari However, while the specifics of Tesla's plans for India remain undisclosed, this visit signals the company's intention to establish a stronger foothold in the country and tap into its growing electric vehicle market. As Tesla explores avenues for collaboration and local partnerships, industry observers eagerly await further developments in this budding relationship. While Tesla has had trouble expanding into India, its rival Mercedes-Benz AG has made efforts to sell locally-made vehicles. The Germany company is placing its bets on India due to the increasing demand for electric vehicles in the country. Last month, the German luxury carmaker announced its plans to launch four new electric vehicles in India in the next 8-12 months to accelerate its electric mobility drive. Apple Inc., the iPhone maker, has chosen India as a secondary manufacturing hub and now generates 7% of the world's smartphone output here.

Musk still needs attorney's approval for Tesla tweets: US court,"Elon Musk still requires a Tesla attorney's approval for posting tweets related to the company, a US court ruled. Musk has been requiring approval since he reached an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018. SEC had accused him of falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for taking Tesla private, which increased the company's share prices.",https://tech.hindustantimes.com/amp/tech/news/elon-musk-must-still-have-his-tweets-approved-by-tesla-lawyer-federal-appeals-court-rules-71684170094542.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Elon Musk cannot back out of a settlement with securities regulators that was reached after his 2018 tweets claiming he had secured funding to take Tesla private caused the electric vehicle maker's share price to jump and led to a temporary halt in trading, an appeals court ruled Monday. The summary order by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan was released just days after a three-judge panel heard lawyers' arguments in the case. Musk had challenged a lower court judges ruling last year requiring him to abide by the deal on the grounds that circumstances have changed and because the decree contains a prior restraint that Musk contends violates the First Amendment. The settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission required that his tweets be approved first by a Tesla attorney. It also called for Musk and Tesla to pay civil fines over the tweets in which Musk said he had funding secured to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The funding wasnt secured and Tesla remains public. In its ruling, the 2nd Circuit said it saw no evidence to support Musks contention that the SEC has used the consent decree to conduct bad-faith, harassing investigations of his protected speech. Instead, it said, the SEC had opened just three inquiries into Musk's tweets since 2018 and each challenged tweet plausibly violated the terms of the consent decree. The appeals court also rejected Musk's prior restraint argument, saying parties entering consent decrees may voluntarily waive their First Amendment and other rights. Lawyers in the case did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The SEC was investigating whether the Tesla CEO's November 2021 tweets asking Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock violated an October 2018 settlement that Musk signed after the SEC brought an enforcement action against him alleging that his tweets about going private violated antifraud provisions of securities laws. In a written ruling in April 2022, Judge Lewis Limon said Musk sent the tweets without getting pre-approval. Musk's deal with the SEC called for Musk and Tesla to each pay $20 million in fines over Musks tweets about having secured funding to take Tesla private. The funding was not secured but Tesla's stock price jumped in response to the tweets and trading in the shares was subsequently halted.

Indian carmakers back zero duty on limited British imports,"Indian carmakers have backed elimination of import tax on a limited number of vehicles in a trade deal with Britain ""if the need arises"", Reuters reported citing documents. ""As a fallback, 0% would also be acceptable, if the need arises during the negotiations,"" the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said in a submission to the commerce ministry.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indias-carmakers-back-zero-duty-on-limited-british-imports-under-trade-deal-10590631.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Indian carmakers have agreed to eliminate import tax on a limited number of vehicles in a trade deal with Britain ""if the need arises"", according to a document seen by Reuters, offering better access to the world's third-largest automobile market. India currently levies 60% and 100% tax on car imports which will be reduced in a phased manner to 10% by year five but only for a maximum of 46,200 vehicles, according to a proposal made by the country's leading auto lobby group to the government. ""As a fall back, 0% would also be acceptable, if the need arises during the negotiations,"" the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said in a submission to the commerce ministry which was seen by Reuters. Outside of this limited quota, SIAM has proposed reducing the import tax on cars to 30% over a 10-year period, a move Reuters has previouslyreported. SIAM is now also willing to explore more cuts after the fifth year depending on how the overall import volume from Britain grows, it said. SIAM, which groups car makers from India's top-seller Maruti Suzuki, to majors such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, and the commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment. India is one of the most protected automobile markets where import taxes are among the highest in the world of any major car making nation. This has drawn the ire of companies like Tesla whichshelvedits entry plans last year. The import tax reductions are aimed at opening up the Indian market, some experts say it might not do much as the number of vehicles proposed under the scheme is small. India sold a record 4 million cars in the country last fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. SIAM's proposal for zero duties is limited to 26,400 cars in the first year, increasing to a maximum of 46,200 over a decade. ""The number of units that will benefit from this quota should also be seen in the context of the Indian market size,"" said an industry source aware of the proposal, which applies only to combustion engine cars with electric, hybrid, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles excluded. Britain has only a handful of car factories run by the likes of Nissan, BMW and Tata's Jaguar Land Rover. SIAM's proposal on zero duties, however, is more geared towards cars with smaller engines which could provide greater benefit to companies like Nissan. This is the first time Indian car makers have agreed to such cuts, caving to pressure from a government that wants them to give up their protectionist position. The companies have previously argued that such a move would dry up investment in domestic manufacturing by making imports cheaper and easier for global automakers. They also fear this could set a precedent in negotiating deals with others like the European Union (EU), Japan or South Korea, sources have previously said. India and Britain started negotiations in January last year for a trade pact that could double trade to $100 billion by 2030. The two countries previously missed an October 2022 deadline to conclude the deal and continue talking through the proposed deal.",

EV ecosystem still not mature in India: Renault India MD & CEO,"Venkatram Mamillapalle, Renault India MD and CEO, believes the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem goes beyond setting up charging stations. ""EV has a lot of safety requirements...the ecosystem for which is still not mature in India...I'm not just talking about...charging stations. It's (about)...indigenisation of batteries, etc. Firemen need to be trained in case the vehicle catches fire,"" he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/creating-an-ecosystem-for-evs-is-not-just-about-building-charging-stations-says-renault-india-md-10560941.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Even though government thinktank Niti Aayog is aiming for electric vehicles (EVs) to comprise at least 30 percent of new passenger vehicles sold by 2030, the country head of Europes largest carmaker believes that they are unlikely to capture a double-digit share. He feels an EV penetration of 3-5 percent is be achievable if the support ecosystem is right. Venkatram Mamillapalle, Renault India Managing Director and CEO, is of the view that the ecosystem goes beyond settingup charging stations. An electric vehicle has a lot of safety requirements, the ecosystem for which is still not mature in India.I'm not just talking about (setting up) charging stations. It is (about) localisation of cells, indigenisation of batteries, etc. Firemen need to be trained in case the vehicle catches fire, and the insurance company needs to know how to assess the fire, he said, while speaking exclusively to Moneycontrol. Mamillapalle said that electric cars account for just 1 percent of the total passenger vehicles sold annuallyin India. ""It will take at least three decades for EVs to reach 99 percent (of total PVs sold). We can have about 3 to 5 percent penetration if the right ecosystem is there. It will take us at least till 2030 to reach that level, he explained. Mamillapalle stated that Renaults EV rollout plans are very much on track. The Nissan-Renault alliance had announced that it will be investing Rs 5,300 crore ($600 million) for developing six new products for the Indian market. While four of them will be brand new C-segment SUVs, there will be two A-segment cars  one each by Renault and Nissan. EVs are in the plan, and we are following the governments CAFE (fuel economy) requirements. While I cannot tell you what (kind of) and how many types of EVs I'm going to launch because it's confidential, I can confirm that India is a focal point for such products and we plan to get into it very strongly in future, added Mamillapalle. He, however, emphasised that internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) will continue to coexist with EVs, and added that globally the company has a strong presence in flex-fuel engine technology which it will get here if theres a demand. Renault, which currently sells the Kwid, Kiger, and Triber in India, will be launching other gasoline-powered models, especially in the SUV space. Last year it sold 87,000 units, and it is looking at flat growth this year. We are more or less towards the SUV segment even if you take the Kwid. It is a small SUV as thats how it was built and designed.Then comes the Kiger, which is already running in the B segment as an SUV. We are now looking at B+ or C segment SUVs for the future. They will be designed, engineered, and manufactured in India, with 90 percent local components. They will be exported as well, Mamillapalle added. He, however, didnt confirm if the next-genDuster will be relaunched in the Indian market. Going forward, Renault India is also looking to enhance the export of its vehicles, from 25 percent of sales currently to 40 percent in the long term. Our ambition is that for any vehicle made here, India will ultimately become the production hub for exports for right hand drive markets such as South Africa. We will continue to work in that direction, whether it is EVs or ICEVs, concluded Mamillapalle.        Discover the latest business news, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

The company, which posted a whopping 125 per cent year-on-year surge in its vehicle sales at 53,721 units in 2022, also sounded hopeful of growing into double-digit this year as well.

""India is an absolutely important market as part of our regional strategy of Skoda Auto, and India will become an export hub for Skoda,"" Petr Solc, Brand Director at Skoda Auto India told PTI in an interaction.                     Volkswagen is already exporting vehicles from India to Mexico and South Africa while Skoda Auto is exporting to the Middle East and North Africa. From next year we will start exporting vehicle kits for assembly in Vietnam, Solc stated.                     Export is already an important part and will continue to be an important part of the strategy for Skoda and Volkswagen, he stated.                     Noting that Skoda Auto India for the first time delivered more than 50,000 cars in the domestic market last year, he said we would like to grow with the market or even faster and our ambition is to grow into double digits.                     He said that 2022 was specific for the company on account of the Slavia launch and added that So, there was this kind of a one-time effect of any new model introduction.                     Now, we have both models (all-new Slavia sedan and Kushaq SUV) in the market and can now enjoy having both models for the full year in the market, he said.                     Solc said that the 7-seater updated SUV Kodiaq will also play a role in terms of the company's growth strategy, particularly when there is much greater supply now.                     To a question on Audi, which at a point of time was the undisputed leader in the domestic premium luxury car market, Christian Cahn Von Seelen, Member of the Board for sales, marketing and digital at SAVWPIL said that its growth has been ""impressive in terms of volume in 2022 compared to the year earlier and that was still hampered significantly by the chip supply situations even in Europe.                     So the growth of Audi is impressive, and we are definitely planning to continueSo as much (as) I think, I can say we will see loads of new product introductions here on the other side.                     On the company's EV foray in the Indian market, Solc said it depends on the development of the segment in the country.                     Late last month, the European car maker Skoda announced its EV  roadmap, which includes six electric cars in a phased manner by 2026.                     ""We as a manufacturer and Skoda, we will be ready. And if we see good traction, we are talking about the prognosis that the car market or the EV can go within 5-10 years, up to 20, maybe 30 per cent. We don't know necessarily, he said.                     So this could be part, we would like to be also within that range, but depends again, on the response. If we see more manufacturers going, there is an infrastructure built here and there's an acceptance from the customers to buy electric cars, and we will be ready, he said.                     He said that the company is discussing which models it should bring in the future also to India as an EV.                     ""And if we see the potential in the market, we will bring them as well. So I cannot say necessarily what the percentage will be. But if the market is going towards more than 20 per cent of the electric vehicles of the total market, we would like to penetrate within the EV segment, Solc added.

Hero Electric denies getting ₹150-250 cr subsidies recovery notice,Hero Electric CEO Sohinder Singh Gill has denied reports claiming the electric two-wheeler manufacturer has received a notice from the government for the recovery of ₹150-250 crore claimed by it in subsidies. Reports had claimed that Hero Electric and Okinawa had received notices in a case related to alleged misappropriation of subsidies under phase II of Centre's FAME scheme.,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/fame-ii-scheme-case-hero-electric-ceo-says-not-received-any-notice-for-subsidy-recovery-awaits-quick-resolution-10503831.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Amid reports of the Union government seeking to recover Rs 150-Rs 250 crore claimed by two-wheeler players Hero Electric and Okinawa as subsidy in the case related to ""alleged misappropriation"" of subsidies given under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, the CEO of the former two-wheeler company denied receiving any such letter from the Ministry of Heavy Industry (MHI). In a statement dated April 30, Hero Electric CEO Sohinder Gill said, ""We have not received any such letter from the Department of Heavy Industries so far but we would be happy to respond to it..."" Gill also said that the company awaits ""any formal communication from MHI towards quickly resolving the subsidy deadlock, as this could be the first step to help us to recover the Rs 500 crore held up with the Department as unpaid subsidy quickly."" The statement comes just days after reports of an investigation ordered by MHI showed the two companies ""allegedly used multiple imported components in electric two wheelers, violating norms. The two companies also face de-recognition under the scheme, barring them from any subsidy payment in future,"" reported The Times of India. Citing sources, an earlierCNBC-TV18 report also added that the authorities have received legal opinion in the matter. The news channel's sources claimed that the probe against Hero Electric and Okinawa revealed that they allegedly claimed subsidies of Rs 250 crore for imported components, but declared the consignments as being made indigenously. Both companies, as per the sources, cited non-disclosure agreements with component suppliers in their replies to the government. ALSO READ:FAME scheme case: Govt mulls clawback of subsidies, FIR against Hero Electric, Okinawa Clarifying on the allegations, Gill defended that Hero Electric has ""followed the entire CMVR (Central Motor Vehicles Rules) and certification process for manufacturing and selling its entire range of e-bikes for the last 15 years and ensured good quality products and efficient after sales service,"" adding that the automaker's core strategy has been to offer ""value-for-money"" and 90 percent of the products have been sensibly priced between Rs 50,000 to Rs 85,000. In terms of hurdles faced by the two-wheeler sector amid the harsh COVID-19 pandemic, Gill also highlighted that the market leaders manufacturing big volumes in the year 2019-21 have been the worst affected because of non-existing supply chain which was further hit by Covid for two consecutive years in 2020 and 2021. Late entrants such as OLA, Bajaj, TVS, Kinetic, Okaya benefitted thanks to the supply chain that was beginning to take off in small numbers, he added. ""The issue that needs to be resolved is therefore pertaining to the 2 to 3 years beginning 2019 that had no supply chain and also suffered a Covid blackout period from whatever small scale Indian component were trying to do,"" Gill added. To be sure, government approved Phase-II of FAME Scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore for a period of three years commencing from 1st April 2019. Out of total budgetary support, about 86 percent of fund has been allocated for demand incentive so as to create demand for xEVs in the country. This phase aims to generate demand by way of supporting 7,000 e-buses, 5 lakh e-3 wheelers, 55,000 e-4 wheeler passenger cars (including strong hybrid) and 10 lakh e-2 wheelers. Albeit the scheme will be applicable mainly to vehicles used for public transport or those registered for commercial purposes, privately-owned registered e-2Ws are also covered under the scheme as a mass segment, the Ministry of Heavy Industries had stated. Highlighting the second phase of the scheme, Gill said that another fact that should be considered is the real objective of FAME II guidelines. Localization to the value of 50 percent is a guiding light towards a Make in India mind set, but a short fall of 5 or 7 or 10 percent in the final product should not be read as a willful default, but a logistical crunch, Gill asserted. The investigation into FAME scheme irregularities was initiated by government testing agencies Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) and the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) after whistleblowers raised apprehensions. As part of the probe, inputs from the commerce ministry and directorate of revenue were sought to crosscheck customs records and ascertain whether there was any deviation from the phased manufacturing programme, the CNBC TV-18 report said. ""We are confident that unlike the previous executives that had blocked all our attempts to find any resolution, the current officials will work towards a practical resolution based on the situation on the ground and quickly reimburse the locked subsidy that has crippled our business operations,"" Gill concluded. Apart from the two companies, 12 other two-wheeler EV makers - Benling, Okaya, Jitendra New EV, Greaves Electric Mobility, Revolt Intellicorp, Kinetic Green Energy, Avon Cycles, Lohia Auto, Thukral Electric & Victory Electric - are under the radar. The investigations against them are currently underway, the CNBC TV-18 report said.       Discover the latest business news, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Removing unnecessary chips from some cars amid shortage: Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki India is working to remove certain semiconductors from some models where the requirement is unnecessary, a company official said. He added that amid the ongoing global chip shortage, Maruti Suzuki remains ""vulnerable to supply side bottlenecks"", but is trying to organise supplies through multiple sources. It couldn't produce around 1.7 lakh units last fiscal due to  chip shortage.",https://www.bqprime.com/markets/maruti-suzuki-remains-vulnerable-to-supply-side-bottlenecks-as-uncertainty-continues-official?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Maruti Suzuki India remains 'vulnerable to supply side bottlenecks' this fiscal even as it looks to source electronic components through multiple sources, according to a senior company official. The country's largest carmaker, which could not produce around 1.7 lakh units last fiscal due to semiconductor shortage, is also coming up with measures to reduce the usage of certain kinds of chips in its cars. ""The problem (chip shortage) is a global one... it could affect different models, different companies, different modules differently... all our efforts are to organise supplies through multiple sources,"" Maruti Suzuki India executive officer (corporate affairs) Rahul Bharti said in an analyst call. He noted that the company is working to do away with certain chips in some models/trims where the requirement is superfluous. ""If there is a particular semiconductor in a particular variant of a model which is superfluous and not required..so we are removing all such needs so that our consumption is minimum. All such efforts are going on including negotiations at global scale. Having said that we are still vulnerable to supply side bottlenecks,"" Bharti noted. When asked about the company position in the ongoing fiscal, he said: ""We do not have full year visibility but at least Q1 will be tough and broadly the uncertainty continues."" Semiconductors are silicon chips that cater to control and memory functions in products ranging from automobiles, computers and cellphones to various other electronic items. The usage of semiconductors in the auto industry has gone up globally in recent times with new models coming with more and more electronic features such as bluetooth connectivity and driver-assist, navigation and hybrid-electric systems. Replying to a query, Bharti confirmed that the strong hybrid technology introduced in Grand Vitara could be launched in more models. ""We have got a very positive response... we plan to bring it (strong hybrid) in more models also,"" he stated. On sales growth outlook for this fiscal, Bharti said industry body SIAM estimates the passenger vehicle industry to grow between 5-7%. ""Maruti Suzuki should grow well beyond this. So we would be better than the industry,"" he noted. MSI CFO Ajay Seth noted that the company has lined up Rs 8,000 crore capex in the current fiscal with capital set to go into the construction of the Sonipat plant, development of new models and annual maintenance of existing infrastructure. He noted that the company has strengthened its presence in the sports utility vehicle segment with Brezza and Grand Vitara thereby increasing its market share in the vertical. ""Moving forward with Jimny and Fronx, the SUV portfolio of the company will be further strengthened. With this the company aims to secure a leadership position in the SUV segment,"" Seth said. He noted that the company believes in offering products and technologies which are relevant to the Indian market context.",

MG Motor India invests ₹800 crore to produce Comet EV in Gujarat,"MG Motor India has said it has invested around ₹800 crore to produce its Comet EV at its Gujarat plant. The firm claims the EV has a range of 230 kilometres on a single charge. ""If you are driving 1,000 kilometres a month, then you need to charge the car just five times,"" MG Motor India President Rajeev Chaba said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/mg-motor-expects-30-of-sales-to-come-from-evs-this-year-gears-up-to-drive-in-electric-hatch-comet-10460701.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"While previewing its electric car Comet, MG Motor India revealed that it has invested around Rs 800 crore to produce the car locally at its plant in Halol, Gujarat. The company anticipates a strong response and will be gradually ramping up the production of this two-door electric car to around 3,000 units a month. With the Comet due to roll out in the coming days, this will be the second electric vehicle (EV) by the British carmaker after the ZS EV, which was launched in India in 2020. Rajeev Chaba, MG Motor India President and MD, during a round table interaction with reporters, claimed that the Comet has a range of 230 kms on a single charge and is well suited for intra-city 'practical' usage. In his view, the cost of ownership is going to be very economical. ALSO READ: Slideshow: Take a look at MG Comet, Indias smallest EV If you are driving 1,000 kms a month, then you need to charge the car just five times. A single charge can do about 200 kms. Assuming that the electricity cost is Rs 6 per unit, you just need to spend Rs 500 for 1,000 kms a month. It means the cost of running this car is less than a pizza, or a PVR ticket, or two cups of coffee, emphasised Chaba. He also stated, As per our survey, people spend Rs 5,000 a month for petrol. In addition to that, maintenance costs are also huge. During the product unveil, MG Motor India announced that the Comet will be equipped with a 17.3 KWH li-ion battery and can be fully charged in around seven hours. While the products price points were not disclosed, it is expected to be in the Rs 10-12 lakh range (ex-showroom). It will be equipped with automatic transmission, two front airbags, and reverse parking camera, among other things. Chaba clarified that the company would not be catering to buyers who do a lot of inter-city trips, and nor will it be looking at fleet operators. ""We will start taking bookings for the Comet from May 15. We are going to be very serious about not selling this car to certain categories of people. Nor are we going to reach out to fleet operators just to push volumes, Chaba said. As reported byAutocar Professional, in order to cater to the anticipated demand for the Comet, MG Motor India will be adding a third shift at its existing plant to expand capacity to 1,20,000 units per annum. The content localisation will be about around 54 percent in the initial phase, and will be enhanced to 60 percent by the end of this year. The company has partnered with Tata AutoComp Systems (TACO) to source batteries for the car. As it gears up to introduce the Comet next month, MG Motor India says it expects 30 percent of its sales to come from the EV segment this year.The company has sold around 10,000 units of ZS EV so far and expects sales of the model to touch 1,000 units a month this year. Last year, the ZS EV comprised 12 percent of its overall sales volume. ""The sale of electric passenger vehicles is set to rise dramatically in India, from around 50,000 units last year to probably around 125,000-130,000 units this year. During 2023, we expect 30 percent of our total sales of around 80,000-90,000 units to come from the two electric models,"" Chaba said, adding, If we are fortunate, we could produce between 80,000 to 1 lakh units this year and next year our output should be 1.2 lakh units."" Chaba also said that the company broke even this March. ""We broke even in March and we should be able to make a little money this year if we are able to sell 80,000 to 1 lakh units."" Citing global trends, he noted that electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales now accounted for 30 per cent of the overall new sales in China. Similarly, EVs account for 20 percent of sales in Europe and 10 percent of the US market, Chaba said. ""In India, EVsare less than 2 percent but this number will go up. For India, the tipping point would be when the penetration levels reach 10 per cent and there are more choices for consumers around the Rs 10 lakh price range,"" he explained.

"Tesla can sell cars for 0 profit, still earn large sums later: CEO","Tesla's billionaire CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is the only automobile firm that could sell for ""zero profit"" now and then yield ""actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy"". ""I'm not sure how many of you will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it's extremely significant,"" Musk added. ""We'll continue to invest in growth,"" he said.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/elon-musk-is-willing-to-bet-tesla-s-profits-on-a-driverless-dream?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is years behind on his ambition to render Tesla Inc.s cars fully autonomous. Hes now saying in no uncertain terms that hes willing to bet the companys profit margins on making it happen. Musk said on a conference call last week that Tesla has the wherewithal to sell cars at zero profit and then earn immense sums later off driverless software. The trouble with that for investors? His predictions since at least 2019 that autonomous Teslas are just around the corner havent panned out. Were the only ones making cars that technically we could sell for zero profit for now, and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy, Musk said April 19. Im not sure how many of you will appreciate the profundity of what Ive just said, but it is extremely significant. The challenge Musk has had turning driverless visions into reality isnt stopping him from going forward with markdowns that threaten to set off a price war. The Austin, Texas-based company has lowered the cost of its top-selling Model Y by 29% in the span of just a few months. Thats dented the companys margins and spooked investors concerned about deteriorating profits. Self-Driving Dreams The dream of a truly self-driving car has animated the auto industry for years, and Teslas CEO has been one of its loudest proponents. But the company has yet to deliver on promises of robotaxis dominating the roads. Tesla offers a system it calls Full Self-Driving that, contrary to its name, merely assists human drivers who are fully responsible for operating the vehicle, and must keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. The company charges customers $15,000 for the optional system and defers some of that revenue because its not a finished product. It wont be until the feature lives up to its billing  something Musk claimed may happen this year. Elon Musk dipped into the well and recycled prior comments around FSD being complete by year-end, demand outstripping supply and vehicles being an appreciating asset over time as full self-driving becomes a reality, Jeffrey Osborne, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said in a note recapping the Tesla CEOs comments. We question all of these assumptions. Tesla has begun to recognize some of its deferred revenue, including $324 million in the fourth quarter of last year  by far the most ever. But even with that bigger-than-usual haul, the carmaker has been recognizing less deferred revenue than its forecast in regulatory filings. At $639 million, its projection for 2023 is the lowest in almost four years. Tesla didnt say in its earnings release or investor call last week how much deferred revenue it recognized in the first quarter. The figure should show up in its 10-Q filing due in the coming days. Software Sales Seth Goldstein at Morningstar Research interpreted Musks zero-profit comment as more of a theoretical, but said the broader strategic goal of making money from selling software services to existing customers makes sense. Elons point is that the greater proportion of people you can get in a [Tesla], the more potential software purchasers there will be, Goldstein said in an interview. And then over time, that can become a very profitable and valuable business because its very high margin. Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn indicated Tesla hasnt abandoned the idea of making money on the cars it sells, telling analysts that reinvestment funded by cash generated from product sales is very important for us. Though the companys cash flow fell to a two-year low in the first quarter. Other automakers are closely watching the EV market leaders moves as they ramp up production of their own battery-powered vehicles. How far Tesla is willing to go to slash prices  and margins  remains a wild card. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com 2023 Bloomberg L.P.",

Louise Thomas Editor Car grilles have been getting increasingly bolder in recent years  from BMWs highly-controversial nostrils to various grilles that are able to illuminate. What a grille has never done before is display warning messages to pedestrians. Until now, as Skoda has devised a way for animations to be displayed at the front to show various warning information. While Skodas electric Enyaq iV is usually equipped with a light-up Crystal Face, as part of a trial the firm has swapped this out with a new body featuring an LED strip that can be configured to display various messages. When the car approaches a pedestrian crossing, it can warn those waiting to cross that it has spotted them. The grille is then able to display green arrows that show its safe for them to cross. Once the car is ready to set off, its able to display a different red signal to show that the car is moving. If the vehicle is unable to stop, its able to display a warning message such as do not step out onto the crossing. Skoda has also been working on a robot called IPA2X that serves to help children, the elderly and those with disabilities to cross the road safely. Supported by the Urban Mobility Initiative of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, various companies have helped to come up with a two-metre-tall robot that looks like a mobile traffic light. The robot constantly monitors the surroundings and is able to display green lights when its safe for pedestrians to cross. Its height means its able to see over parked cars too. Skoda is continuing to test the two technologies in Italy and the Czech Republic, and will do so into 2024, with the hopes they might be rolled out as early as 2025.

Domestic Sales Performance: Commercial Vehicles: Domestic sale of MH&ICV in Q4 2023, including trucks and buses, stood at 54,435 units, compared to 40,391 units in Q4 2022. Total sales for MH&ICV Domestic & International Business in Q4 2023, including trucks and buses, stood at 56,059 units compared to 52,976 units in Q4 2022. Mr. Girish Wagh, Executive Director, Tata Motors Ltd. said,Tata Motors commercial vehicle domestic sales in Q4 FY23 at 1,12,145 units was 22% higher than the previous quarter (Q3 FY23) and ~2% higher than the same quarter, last year (Q4 FY22). This growth was driven by the robust demand for heavy trucks required to service the strong infrastructure push by the Government plus increased activity in e-commerce, construction, and mining. Higher replacement demand, advance buying in anticipation of price hikes, and year-end buying to claim depreciation benefits, further buoyed the demand towards the end of the quarter. As a result, M&HCVs grew by over 33% vs Q3 FY23, while being 18% ahead of Q4 FY22. However, the demand for small and light commercial vehicles continued to be impacted due to high interest rates and high base effect. Overall, Tata Motors CV domestic business grew ~22 % in FY23 vs FY22. With the new BSVI phase II starting from April 2023, we have used the opportunity to significantly enhance key attributes of our entire portfolio while complying with the emission norms. Our commercial vehicles will now deliver even better performance enabled by smarter technologies and enhanced features. With the governments continuing thrust on infrastructure development, we remain optimistic about the overall CV demand in FY24 while maintaining a close watch on geopolitical developments, interest rates, fuel prices and inflation. Passenger Vehicles: Includes sales of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited, a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited. Mr. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd. said, FY23 has set a new record for passenger vehicle sales in India. The steep growth witnessed by the industry was driven by post COVID pent up demand in early part of the year, the launch of several new vehicles and easing of the semiconductor shortage. While SUVs and EVs led this growth, customers rising preference for safe vehicles and smart technology features was equally pronounced. Tata Motors scaled a new sales peak by posting its highest ever annual domestic sales of 5,38,640 units, achieving a robust 46% sales growth over FY22 and registering its third successive year of industry beating growth. All four SUVs  Nexon, Punch, Harrier and Safari, recorded their highest ever annual sales, contributing a substantial 66% of the total volume. Being the leader in fast growing EV segment, we continued to accelerate both its adoption as well as the development of its enabling ecosystem. Tata Motors crossed the significant landmark of 50,000 EV sales in FY23, its highest ever, to post a significant growth of 154% over FY22. In addition, we also recorded the highest ever quarterly and monthly EV sales of 15,960 (Q4FY23) and 6,509 (Mar23) respectively. EV penetration in our portfolio continued to increase from ~7% (Q1FY23) to ~12% (Q4FY23) of our total sales. Looking ahead, we expect the demand for personal vehicles to remain robust with the trend of electrification further strengthening as more options are made available to customers plus support from a rapidly growing and improving ecosystem. However, the growth rate of the passenger vehicle industry may moderate due to a strong base effect as well as macro factors including hardening interest rates, rising inflation, and the cost impact from progressive regulatory norms. We continue to stay agile, carefully monitoring the supply situation, particularly semiconductors and any potential waves of Covid.                                             July 1, 2024                                                                                         Tata Motors registered total sales of 229,891 units in Q1 FY25                                                                                         June 25, 2024                                                                                         Tata Motors partners with Bajaj Finance for seamless Commercial Vehicle Financing                                                                                         June 20, 2024                                                                                         Tata Motors launches Fleet Verse, a digital marketplace for its entire range of commercial vehicles                                                                                         June 19, 2024                                                                                         Tata Motors announces price increase of its commercial vehicles from July 2024                                             Social Media + Subscribe   Copyright                    2024.

Tesla under investigation in US over steering wheels that come off,"US regulators are investigating Tesla's Model Y SUV following two reports that said steering wheels came off while being driven. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in US said the vehicles were delivered with a missing bolt which holds the wheel to the steering column. Both the incidents happened while the SUVs had low mileage, the NHTSA said.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/tesla-under-investigation-by-us-for-detached-steering-wheels?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is under investigation by US regulators over complaints the steering wheel can fall off certain new Model Y vehicles while theyre in use. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said its aware of two incidents in which the wheel detached from the steering column while drivers were operating the 2023 model year SUVs. The preliminary evaluation, opened March 4, applies to an estimated 120,089 vehicles, according to a filing posted on NHTSAs website. The affected vehicles were delivered to owners without the retaining bolt that holds the steering wheel in place, the agency said. NHTSA is assessing the scope, frequency and manufacturing processes associated with this condition. There are no known injuries or deaths related to the issue, NHTSA said. Tesla didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. The move by NHTSA is the latest in a series of investigations targeting Tesla, its products and its chief executive officer, Elon Musk. The Austin, Texas-based automaker last month recalled 362,758 electric vehicles after NHTSA said Teslas automated-driving technology could increase the risk of a crash. Read more: Tesla Recalls Cars Over Driving Software Crash Risk A Tesla owner in New Jersey posted photos on Twitter in January that appeared to show a detached steering wheel in a Model Y he said he received several days earlier. He said in subsequent tweets that Tesla agreed to replace the vehicle and that NHTSA had contacted him about the issue. Tesla shares fell 3.2% at 9:50 a.m. in New York. The Model Y is a key product for Tesla, which recently started manufacturing the vehicle at its two newest plants  one outside Berlin and the other in Austin. The company reports a combined figure for Model Y and Model 3 deliveries and handed over more than 1.2 million of the vehicles last year. The Model Y was the best-selling EV globally last year and could be one of the top vehicles of any type this year, according to BloombergNEF. Steering wheel detachments, while rare, are not unique to Tesla. In August, Ford Motor Co. recalled 692 F-53 Motorhome Stripped Chassis and F-59 Commercial Stripped Chassis vehicles because the steering wheel attachment bolt could loosen and separate from the steering column. It also recalled about 1.3 million Ford and Lincoln brand vehicles in 2018 over a similar problem. (Updates with details on probe from third paragraph.)

The industry is expected to end FY23 with a growth of 15% year-on-year.

The auto components industry which clocked a turnover of $56.5 billion in FY22 with a growth of 23% over the previous year is expected to end FY23 with a growth of 15%. The domestic components industry stands to gain from the manufacturing of components for internal combustion engines moving to India as the major Western markets of U.S. and Europe migrate towards electric vehicles. ""In the first nine months that have gone by, that is until December 2022, our export and import continue to be really very well balanced and they are both at $15.1 billion,"" Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India Director General Vinnie Mehta told reporters in an interaction here on the sidelines of an event organised by the industry body. He said, ""We are wary of the fact of the headwinds because of recessionary trends in Europe and the U.S. Despite these trends, we feel that our exports are growing in the expected trajectory. We haven't found any slowdown happening in exports. Also imports, because the domestic market has picked up quite strongly."" When asked about the outlook for FY24, Mehta said, ""On a conservative approach, for FY24 (we) will surely grow in the range of 10-15%."" ACMA President Sunjay Kapur said, ""So given the fact that it (growth) is continuing, we expect things to continue in the same way. We're not seeing any signs of a major recession in the US, the way people have talked about it last year, or the last quarter of the last calendar year."" As per industry feedback, he said, ""From what we're hearing, the January numbers have been good and strong, and therefore, we hope and foresee that it will continue."" Also, Kapur said, ""The domestic industry is looking very positive in terms of growth and we will see good growth and then carry forward whatever we lack in exports, we will see that covered by the domestic industry."" Further, he said in the short to medium term Indian auto components industry is gaining from the transition to EV in the developed markets in the West. ""Anything that's happening in the ICE space, a lot of it is moving to India because a lot of tier one suppliers have discontinued investing in the ICE design and development for OEMs because of the roadmap of going electric,"" he added. Moreover, a lot of the traditional components that are being manufactured, also have the option to move to India, as they discontinue manufacturing in the Western world, Kapur said.",

"Low GDP growth, El Nino major risks to auto sector in FY24: Maruti","The major challenges facing the auto sector in 2023-24 include heatwaves and disrupted monsoons due to El Nino and lower-than-estimated GDP growth, Maruti Suzuki Executive Director Shashank Srivastava said. Agricultural output could decrease due to El Nino, raising inflation rate and lowering rural incomes, he mentioned, adding that rural sales contribute 44% of the overall sales of the company.",https://www.bqprime.com/markets/maruti-lists-major-risks-to-auto-sector-in-202324?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The major factors that the auto industry should be careful about in 202324 are heatwave, disruption to monsoon, higher repo rate and lower-than-estimated growth of the gross domestic product, according to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.  Amid these potential risks, analysts said higher discounts in comparison to the same period last year, reduced waiting periods for key models and decline in sales of luxury cars indicated a slowdown in the category. They expect the growth in retail sales of passenger vehicles to moderate sharply to mid to high single digits. Concerns of sales slowdown in the auto industry may have risen from the lower retail sales as compared with wholesales and higher inventory at dealerships, Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer of marketing and sales at Maruti Suzuki, told BQ Prime. The inventory at the industry level rose to 2.19 lakh units from 1.84 lakh units last month. This is the first time after a long time that inventory has risen to three-weeks, Srivastava said. ""Probably, that's making them conclude that there's a slowdown,"" he said. ""However, actual data so far hasn't indicated that."" Srivastava said there are, of course, basic economic fundamentals that can lead to the slowing down of auto sales. He was referring to the concerns around the lower-than-estimated GDP growth in the next fiscal and the Met office's warning of more heatwaves and the disruption in monsoon due to El Ninowarmer-than-usual waters linked with poor rainfall. Rural sales contribute 44% of the overall sales of the largest carmaker in India. Those are highly correlated with agriculture income, which is correlated with how the monsoon performs, according to Srivastava. He said the effect of El Nino could affect agricultural output, pushing up inflation and lowering rural incomes. ""Both are actually not good for the auto industry."" The Maruti Suzuki executive also highlighted the rising interest rates as another key concern. The RBI has raised its benchmark rate by 250 basis points since May and banks have started a pass-through into auto loan retail rates as well, increasing interest rates by 180250 bps, according to Srivastava. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Retail sales are highly dependent on loans in India, with 80% of the sales coming through financing, Srivastava said. Srivastava underscored that the industry has some positive things to look forward to as well. The budgetary provisions for infrastructure spending can have a very good effect on both demand and supply management. If the GDP does grow at the government's estimated 6.5% in the next fiscal, it will be good for the auto industry, he said. Amid this, Maruti Suzuki will look to become the top manufacturer in the sport-utility-vehicle category, where it has lagged due to limited models. Jimny and Fronxthe recent unveils in the categoryhave got 21,000 and 12,000 bookings, bolstering Maruti Suzuki's standing in the segment.",

The transport department of India's capital on Feb. 19, issued newspaper ads asking digital companies to ""immediately stop"" allowing personal bike taxis that offer commercial, ride-hailing services on their apps as they violated city rules. As of Tuesday, bike taxis continue to be available for booking on Uber and Ola apps in New Delhi. Delhi is a key market for ride-hailing firms. Uber says in 2022, more than 1.9 million trips took place to and from metro rail stations in Delhi on Uber Moto, its bike taxi service. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary and commissioner for transport in Delhi government, last week sent warning notices for non-compliance to Uber and Ola, asking them why they should not be penalised. The companies were given a week to respond. ""There is clearly a violation of law ... For the next few days we will watch what they do and then consider next steps including all legal options which we are well within our rights to use,"" Kundra said. Uber, he added, has sought a meeting with Delhi officials to discuss the matter. Uber and Softbank Group-backed Ola did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment on Delhi city's warning letters. The Feb. 19 newspaper ad said companies can face a penalty of up to 100,000 rupees ($1,209) for non-compliance. For drivers of bike taxis, the penalties could be as high as 10,000 rupees ($121) and a jail term of up to one year. The enforcement of rules for bike taxis by Delhi government follows similar moves by Maharashtra and Karnataka states. Delhi official Kundra said while the use of personal vehicles as bike taxis was not allowed under city rules, it also poses a safety concern as they do not have the same checks as commercially-registered vehicles, such as police verification of drivers. ""The rider could be anyone and we have to be mindful of concerns around passenger safety, especially women,"" Kundra said. ""Companies cannot ride roughshod over law.""",

Looking at India amid global geopolitical tensions: Volkswagen,"Arno Antlitz, the CFO and COO of the Volkswagen Group, said that the group is looking towards India to position itself more robustly in the world. The company will have to take an even more global approach amid growing geopolitical tensions and an increasingly complex regulatory environment to be truly resilient, he claimed while speaking to Porsche Consulting Magazine.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/volkswagen-to-revisit-india-amid-china-geopolitical-uncertainty?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Europes largest carmaker is taking a closer look at India  again. Volkswagen AG wants to remain a strong player in Europe and China, but in the face of growing geopolitical tensions and an increasingly complex regulatory environment, the German carmaker is looking beyond the US for markets with growth potential, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said. Were turning our attention to India to be more robustly positioned in this new world, Antlitz said in an interview with Porsche Consulting Magazin. India has enormous growth potential in my view. The effort will mark yet another attempt by the company to break into the Indian market in a significant way. The carmakers earlier efforts to boost its presence in India have often been bruising experiences. An alliance with Suzuki Motor Corp. ended in a fierce legal dispute before a single car was built and talks over teaming up with Jaguar-maker Tata Motors didnt go anywhere. But as US-China tensions mount and the Asian giants seeming support of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine raises hackles, Indias large potential market is once again drawing the companys attention. Indias population surpassed that of Chinas at the end of last year, and with half of that population under the age of 30, it has potential to become the worlds fastest-growing major economy in coming years. Public adoption of electric passenger transport has been slow in India, with high upfront production costs deterring manufacturers and a dearth of charging infrastructure deterring consumers. But demand for low-cost battery-powered SUVs is growing, and homegrown carmakers are now finding themselves competing with Chinese and South Korean manufacturers for market share. READ MORE: Bigger Is Better in Indias Nascent Electric Car Market Volkswagen said in August it was moving forward with a component supply deal for five new electric sport utility vehicles from Indias Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., adding that it wanted to explore ways of working together to electrify the Indian market more quickly. Antlitz said it remained unclear how the global economy would develop under the continued pressure of supply chain bottlenecks, which limits the number of cars that can be manufactured and sold. Given the possibilities of a worsening economy and shrinking demand, Volkswagen is keen to avoid price discounts in coming months. We expect that the worldwide semiconductor supply will improve in 2023, he said. That means a reduced demand would meet improved supply. And at that point we shouldnt allow ourselves to fall back into the habit of rebates. We have to maintain price discipline. Hedging remains a key tool for Volkswagens ability to cope with rising raw material costs, Antlitz said, but that will be secondary to a vertical-integration strategy. The bigger lever is entering the raw material chain yourself and keeping value creation more firmly in your own grasp, he said, adding that investment in vertical integration should occur very, very selectively.

Assisted by a plethora of sensors, Tesla cars are preferred for their advanced features and energy-efficient abilities which connect drivers to the path of innovation. However, a recent video that surfaced online showed a Tesla car mistaking a train for a bunch of trucks that highlighted the innovative cars technology defect. This made the driver take a jibe at the companys software glitch by posting it on social media. In the video shared on Twitter, a Tesla car driver could be seen waiting at a level crossing for the train to pass when the display showed a glitch and prompted him to record the same. The screen depicted the train as a bunch of trunks that were moving in sync one after the other to block the way for Tesla. Thus, the goods train shown as loaded slow-moving trucks attracted trolls on the micro-blogging site which is also owned by Elon Musk.   So well engineered that they forgot to teach it about trains,"" quipped a user while another one commented, If Tesla knew about trains, nobody would drive.""         Meanwhile, the other chunk of users didnt take it as a joke (as it was meant to be) and slammed the driver for not driving according to his senses. Are there trains sufficiently discontinuous to make that a visual possibility? Did you fail to see the red-light icon also on the screen? I am thinking that your lack of attention to such things makes you more of a road hazard than even a tesla,"" replied an aggrieved user. As someone with myopia, here is something I have learned about driving; it is not necessary to know precisely what something is in order to not hit it with a car,"" mentioned the other.     This compelled the Twitter user, James Urbaniak, to point out that his tweet was intended to be a joke. My most viral tweet! Im out of town & a nice person lent me a Tesla for the weekend.

This represents the largest EV partnership yet between an automaker and a ridesharing platform in India. It will supercharge the transition to zero emissions on the Uber platform as we work towards building a sustainable future, said Prabhjeet Singh, President, of Uber India and South Asia. Tata Motors will begin the deliveries of the cars to Uber fleet partners in a phased manner starting in February. In July 2021, Tata Motors launched the XPRES brand exclusively for fleet customers, and the XPRES-T EV is the first vehicle under this brand. The new XPRES-T electric sedan comes with 2 range options  315 km and 277 km.

Tesla recalls 3.62 lakh cars in US over self-driving crash risk,"Tesla is recalling over 3.62 lakh vehicles after US regulator said its self-driving technology could increase the risk of a crash. The recall affects Model 3, Model X, Model Y and Model S units manufactured between 2016 and 2023. Tesla claimed that it is not aware of any injuries or deaths that may be linked with the recall issue.",https://www.bqprime.com/business/tesla-recalls-362-758-cars-due-to-full-self-driving-crash-risk?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is recalling hundreds of thousands of vehicles after US authorities said its automated-driving technology could increase the risk of a crash. The automakers so-called Full Self-Driving Beta system may allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections, including traveling straight through from a turn lane and proceeding through steady-yellow traffic lights, according to a filing Thursday with the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The systems errors increase the risk of a collision if the driver does not intervene, the filing said. The recall affects 362,758 vehicles, including certain Model 3, Model X, Model Y and Model S units manufactured between 2016 and 2023. Tesla is expected to fix the issue through an over-the-air software update by April 15, NHTSA said. The agencys concerns raise new questions about a system that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sees as critical to the companys long-term prospects. The overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving, Musk said in a June 2022 interview with Tesla fans on YouTube. Thats essential. Its really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero. While Musk didnt address the specifics of NHTSAs filing, he tweeted Thursday that the term recall was flat wrong since the issues can be fixed with a software update. The companys automated-driving technology is already under scrutiny from Washington. NHTSA has been looking into how it handles crash scenes since 2021 after a dozen collisions with first responders and other vehicles. The agency also opened an investigation last year into complaints of Tesla cars with Autopilot driver-assist that suddenly brake at high speeds. NHTSA said in a separate statement Thursday that its investigations of Teslas Autopilot are still active. The company has also been accused of exaggerating the capabilities of its technology. The main problems for Teslas system include the misleading names of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, said David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. He added that Tesla does not have adequate safeguards to ensure drivers will pay full attention to the road. The companys website stresses that its autonomous features like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. Tesla shares turned negative after the recall notice, falling 5.7% by market close on Thursday. Potential Concerns The agency said it first notified Tesla on Jan. 25 that it had identified potential concerns related to certain operational characteristics of FSD Beta in four specific roadway environments and requested that the automaker file a recall. Tesla met with the agency multiple times in the following days. The company did not concur with the agencys analysis, but decided on Feb. 7 to move forward with the recall out of an abundance of caution, according to NHTSA. Representatives of Tesla didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla identified 18 warranty claims between May 2019 and September 2022 that may be related to the conditions NHTSA was concerned about, but told the agency it is not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the defect. Its encouraging that Tesla is not trying to fight this and is working with NHTSA, said Missy Cummings, a professor at George Mason University who specializes in autonomous systems and spent a year at the agency. Its a good sign that the company is maturing.

False: Tesla on allegation of it firing workers over union efforts,"Tesla on Thursday responded to a workers' complaint filed with US authorities that accused the company of firing some employees in response to a union campaign. Tesla said it's a ""false allegation"". The company terminated about 4% of the employees on the Autopilot labelling team at a New York plant as part of a performance review cycle, Tesla stated.",https://theprint.in/tech/tesla-says-it-laid-off-4-new-york-employees-before-union-campaign/1377686/?amp=&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2023		 (Reuters) -Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it laid off 4% of the employees in the Autopilot labeling team in Buffalo as part of a performance review cycle conducted every six months.  The automaker responded to a union complaint filed with a government agency alleging that the company laid off dozens of employees from its Autopilot department at its Buffalo plant in New York, a day after workers launched a campaign to form a union.  The company said the impacted employees were identified on Feb. 3, which was before the union campaign was announced. We became aware of organizing activities approximately 10 days later, the company said, adding that the layoffs predated any union campaign.     Earlier this week, Tesla workers in New York said they will unionize with Workers United Upstate New York, which would help give them a voice at their workplace. The Workers United Upstate New York union in a filing with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) earlier on Wednesday accused the worlds most valuable automaker of hitting back by terminating some of the employees in retaliation for union activity. The company fired more than 30 employees, the union said in the statement, adding that the workers also received an email with an updated policy, which prohibits them from recording workplace meetings without all participants permission.  This policy violates federal labor law and also flouts New Yorks one-party consent law to record conversations. Over the last six months, the company said the departments employee base has grown 54% to 675 employees as of the beginning of this week, from 437 earlier. The employees had asked the electric carmaker to respect their right to organize a union and called on the company to sign the Fair Election Principles, which would prevent Tesla from threatening or retaliating against the workers. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has in the past been vocal about his opposition to unions and said in a 2018 tweet that employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union, prompting the NLRB to ask him to delete the tweet.

""100 per cent road tax exemption will be provided till December 31, 2025 for the EV battery operated vehicles -- two-wheelers, private cars, three-seater auto-rickshaws, transport vehicles, light goods carriers."" The state government would develop industry-academia linkages to create a skilled workforce pool for EVs besides promoting Chennai, Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai, Salem, Tirunelveli as pilot cities for implementing 'e-mobility solutions'. The policy also proposes to support electrification of commercial and public transport fleets. It offers several incentives to companies engaged in manufacturing of EVs including, 'reimbursement of SGST', turnover-based subsidy and capital subsidy. Electric vehicle projects undertaken by the company would be entitled to 100 per cent exemption on stamp duty on purchase or lease of land obtained from the government. State Transport Undertaking operated buses which constitute a substantial percentage of the public transport in India would be electrified through a phased augmentation and replacement plan. ""The state shall endeavour to increase the share of electric buses to 30 per cent of the fleet by 2030"", the policy said.",

Louise Thomas Editor Elon Musk has responded to an advert shown during the Super Bowl on Sunday shows a Tesla car crashing and killing children. One of Teslas biggest critics organised the advertisement to highlight the dangers of self-driving cars, doing so while founder Elon Musk was in the audience of the game. Millions of Americans and people all over the world gathered to watch the annual NFL championship game on Sunday. Alongside watching the game, the halftime show and even the ads are part of the entertainment. This year, viewers were shown an ad of a self-driving Tesla 3 car ignoring a school buss warning lights and crashing into a child mannequin, hitting a pram and speeding past no-entry signs.  It was organised by Dan ODowd, a tech entrepreneur from California who is campaiging against the Tesla self-driving cars. The 66-year-old believes the cars are a danger to others on the roads.  Musk, who was sitting in the audience of the Super Bowl on Sunday, was spotted talking to owner of the Fox empire Rupert Murdoch just after the half time show featuring Rihanna. Musk has previously said it would be morally wrong to ban self-driving cars, as they save lives. Appearing at Nvidias developers conference in 2015, Musk said humans driving cars is too dangerous. He said: You cant have a person driving a two-tonne death machine. The graphic ad from safety advocacy group The Dawn Project was shown in several parts of the US, including in Washington DC. Before the game, Mr ODowd tweeted: Watch The Dawn Projects #SuperBowl ad demonstrate critical safety defects in @Tesla. Full Self-Driving. 6 months ago we reported FSD [Full Self-Driving] would run down a child. Tesla hasnt even fixed that! To focus their attention, @NHTSAgov must turn off FSD until Tesla fixes all safety defects. Nearly all of the deniers below have a huge conflict of interest. They are $TSLA shareholders desperately trying to cover up grotesque safety defects in @Tesla Full Self-Driving just to line their own pockets. We publish footage of each test, including multiple angles showing controls not touched, and fanboys still confidently assert we faked them! To remove all doubt that these severe safety defects are real we invite @ElonMusk, @NHTSAgov, the media to witness a public demonstration. Its estimated that a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl costs around $7 million (5.81 million), according to statista.com. Self-driving cars are not yet available to buy.

"Tesla was a wake-up call, it shook up the auto sector: Ferrari CEO","Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna in an interview said Elon Musk-led Tesla's big contribution to the automotive industry was being ""a wake-up call"". ""Things used to happen too slowly. Tesla shook up the industry and accelerated processes and decisions. They were faster and more agile,"" Vigna stated. However, he added that Tesla is a ""functional"" car while Ferrari makes ""emotional"" cars.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/ferrari-ceo-benedetto-vigna-moves-fast-like-elon-musk-while-forging-own-path-on-evs-10072631.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"One turns 20 this year, the other shipped its first car shortly after World War II. The former wantsto bring sustainable transportationto the masses, while the latter sells speed and extravagance to the worlds wealthiest. Ones carsquietly whir, and the others roar. Tesla Inc. andFerrari NVhave little in common, and wont for another few years. But in one of the few interviews hes given since becoming chief executive officer of the Italian supercar manufacturer 17 months ago,Ferrari Chief Executive Officer Benedetto Vigna complimented the electric vehicle maker led by Elon Musk while drawing clear distinctions between their respective paths forward. Speaking at FerrarisMaranelloheadquarters, Vigna, 53, credited Tesla with accelerating change within an industry steeped in engine cylinders. The executive who pioneered sensorsused in billions ofiPhonesdiscussed how Ferrari will navigate the shift to batteries from combustion engines, the runaway success of the brandsnewest model lineand the future of luxury. Here are excerptsfrom theconversation that have been edited and condensed for length andclarity: What have you learned from Tesla? The big contribution that Tesla has made to the automotive industry? It was a wake-up call. Things used to happen too slowly. Tesla shook up the industry andaccelerated processes and decisions. They were faster and more agile. How unique is Ferraris path toward electrification? Electrification is a new way to provide our customers a unique driving experience, and Ive no doubt that our electric powertrains will give clients the same thrills of combustion engines. The point is how to extract the best emotion from the use of this technology, giving something unique to the clients. Driving thrills is a combination of factors: longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, sound, gear-changing and braking. This doesnt change if the powertrain is electric. Is Ferrari on track with its electrification plans? Yes, were fully on track to unveil our first fully electric Ferrari in 2025. That means it will go into the market the following year. What will be the main differences between an electric Ferrari and other cars? Well, there are functional cars, that have the goal of moving people from point A to point B, emitting zero carbon dioxide. You dont care about its brand;what really matters is that it moves you. Separately, there are emotional cars that gives you a unique driving experience, like Ferraris. How do you consider Tesla? For me, its a functional car. Its meant to go from one point to another. Theres a perception Ferrari has been slower with respectto electrification than some competitors. Thats not true.I just think a company like us cant impose any choice on clients, and thats why well keep offering a mix of technology for as long as its feasible. That means internal combustionengines, hybridsand fully electric models. Youre going electric, but the long-awaited Purosangue unveiled just a few months agowill only be powered by combustion engines. What was behind this decision? That shows theres still room for a mix of technology. Weve filled the order bookfour times faster than our original plan. Still, I can reiterate that Purosangues contribution to our deliveries wont exceed 20% during the models life cycle. Can you tell us more about the Purosangue order book? The only thing I can tell you is that we are in line with other models, so we have orders placed for deliverygoing well into 2024. What are your views on electrification? Some regulators at a certain point decided that the community should go into electric, right or wrong. And it is this is going to happen. Electrification is just one piece of the pie, and theres indeed too much hype about it as well as on software and the debate about the need to consolidate the supply chain. Most people are looking too much at the technology itself, soyou have people talking about things such as axial flow, radial flow andpower density, when the most important thing is the clients perception. What do you mean? Electrifying cars is relatively easy from technological point of view. The real point is how to extract the best emotion for the use of this technology you want to provide to the driver. Technology is just a tool, and I think theres too much money poured into this, and this is because theres a lack of deep knowledge. What is the biggest threat you see for Ferrari? I cant see any specific threat for Ferrari.There is a threat for the luxury industry overall, which is how will new generations react to luxury goods? Thats why Im putting a lot of attention on sustainability, a true sustainability action plan. When I say that we want to be carbon neutral by the end of 2030, I mean that by end of 2030, I want to sharply cut emissions. What would you like your legacy to be? What Id like to leave is a company where there is more empowerment at all levels, thats more unified. I want decisions to be taken at all levels. Theres this trend in Latin culture companiesto wait for the boss to tell the people what they have to do. Do it, full stop. How do you measure success? Its all about how quickly you understand the environment around you and how quickly you adapt and make decisions, partially with the brain and partially with the gut. If you believe you need to wait to have the whole range of elements to make the final decision, well, its too late.",

Wadhwa, a Washington Post columnist and academic with stints at Harvard University, Stanford andCarnegie Mellon, has strongly defended Musk and Tesla on past occasions. He told Insider he considered Elon Musk a friend, having first met him for an interview in 2013. The two had a chance to talk off-camera too and Musk told Wadhwa of his plans to retire on Mars. Wadhwa said he was impressed by Musk and continued speaking to him in the following years. He took Musk's side in opinion pieces, and the Tesla boss endorsed his book. ""I used to call him a friend,"" Wadhwa told Insider. ""Maybe he wouldn't call me one, but I did. I will always call him the greatest innovator of our time."" Also read:US SEC probes Elon Musk's role in Tesla self-driving claims But he's more cautious now, after at least two incidents with Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode (FSD), which has been in focus because of safety concerns. Wadhwa told Insider he was one of the first buyers of the Tesla Model S. Later, he sold it to get a new car to avail the Full Self-Driving feature. One day, he said, his Tesla crashed into his garage when he used the Summon mode. In another instance, the car almost crashed on a road. ""It really shook me up,"" Wadhwa said. ""If I hadn't slammed on the brakes, that might have been the first filmed Autopilot crash."" Wadhwa clarified that his complaint was only about FSD and he still considered Tesla to be a ""beautiful"" car. But will he buy it again? Certainly not. ""I didn't get the Full Self-Driving that I was promised,"" Wadhwa said, adding that he felt duped. ""It's still a beautiful car. But, my next car will not be a Tesla. There's no way."" Not just that, Wadhwa said if there is a class-action lawsuit over FSD mode, he will join it immediately. He also wants a refund of $15,000, the amount he spent on the technology. Recently, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak had also called out Tesla and Musk for ""misleading"" buyers. Wozniak told CNBC he had spend huge amounts of money onself-driving technology since 2016. They have robbed my familymyself and my wifeof so much money I couldnt tell you, with things they said that we really believed would be real, Wozniak said.A lot of honesty disappears when you look at Elon Musk and Tesla."" Tesla says its Full Self Driving Capability and Autopilot mode need a fully attentive drivers, with hands on the wheel and ready to take over any moment. Authorities have argued the term ""fullself-driving"" becomes misleading then. Tesla's driver assistance features are under investigation by theUS Department of Justice . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also reviewing them.",

Single-letter licence plate sells for ₹27 crore in Hong Kong,A single-letter licence plate featuring just the letter 'R' was sold for HK$25.5 million (around ₹27 crore) at a Lunar New Year auction organised by the Hong Kong Transport Department.

Sundays bid was for a license plate with the letter R and came at a Lunar New Year auction organized by the Hong Kong Transport Department. It was just short of a record HK$26 million bid for the letter W in 2021, according torankingspublished by the Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung.  There have been more than 160 auctions and over 40,000 plates have been registered since the personalized car plate system was introduced in 2006, bringing in more than HK$600 million for the government, according to Lam. People can register to apply for their license plate of choice, kicking off a process that sometimes lasts as long as 18 months before the plate goes on auction. Applicants must pay HK$5,000 deposit, and if there are no other bidders, then that plate will be theirs for the deposit amount. The winning bid for R was 5,100 times the reserve price and represented more than 80% of the total raised at Sundays auction, the government said in astatement. Users on Hong Kong social media forum LIHKG said the reason for the high bid may be that R is the first letter in the word rich. It could also be down to feng shui, with R representing good fortune for the next 20 years, local media HK01 reported. The Transport Department declined to provide any further information on the winning bidder.",

The US transportation agency determined that the probable cause of the Spring, Texas, electric vehicle crash was the drivers excessive speed and failure to control his car. This was due to impairment from alcohol intoxication in combination with the effects of two sedating antihistamines, resulting in a roadway departure, tree impact and post-crash fire, the safety board said in its report. As for Autopilot, the NTSB determined it wasnt in use because the system is not programmed to not go faster than 30 mph on the street the Tesla last travelled. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating self-driving claims made by Tesla CEO Musk. The SEC probe is to determine if the electric car-maker flouted its rules in promoting its full-self driving (FSD) and Autopilot software. In September last year, a Tesla owner sued the electric car maker, saying the company and its CEO are deceptively and misleadingly marketing the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software. Musk had come under heavy scrutiny on the controversial Autopilot advanced driver assistance system that has allegedly killed many, with both federal and state regulators turning up the heat on the electric car-maker. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) upgraded its investigation from a preliminary evaluation to an engineering analysis, asking Tesla to answer questions about its cabin camera as part of a probe into 830,000 vehicles that include Autopilot.

"Tata considering Spain, Britain for Euro EV battery plant: Report","Tata Motors is considering setting up a battery cell plant for EVs in Spain or Britain, Reuters reported citing source. Tata told the Spanish government following talks late last year that it was considering the country and Britain as top two locations for the plant, the source said. Tata's Jaguar Land Rover unit has manufacturing facilities in Britain and Slovakia.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/tata-considers-spain-britain-for-european-ev-battery-plant-report-10000601.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"India's Tata is considering setting up a battery cell plant for electric vehicles (EV) in Spain or Britain, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as the carmaker seeks to boost supply chains in Europe. Tata's chief financial officer told Reuters last month the carmaker was considering setting up plants in India and Europe to produce battery cells for EVs. In Europe it would aim to provide batteries for its luxury Jaguar Land Rover unit, which has manufacturing facilities in Britain and Slovakia. The company told the Spanish government following talks late last year that it was considering the country and Britain as the two top locations for the plant, said the source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Tata was attracted by Spain's allocation of European Union pandemic relief funds to promote EV and battery manufacturing, and its status as a member of the EU unlike Britain following its departure from the bloc, added the source. A company spokesperson said ""as a policy and practice, Tata Motors doesn't comment on speculation"". The Spanish government did not respond to a request for comment. The location being considered by Tata in Spain is an industrial lot in the town of Zuera, outside the city of Zaragoza in northeastern Spain, the same site Volkswagen considered for a battery plant it is now building elsewhere in the country, the source said. Tata representatives from India and Britain participated in the joint meetings with officials from the Spanish and the Aragon regional governments, the source said, adding that there were also visits to the potential location. Jaguar Land Rover and the Aragon regional government which includes Zuera declined to comment. As Europe's second largest car-producing country behind Germany, Spain launched in 2021 an ambitious programme to attract EV-related investments mostly using EU funds. It was seen as a key factor in convincing Volkswagen to locate its Southern Europe battery plant in Spain and plans to start manufacturing EVs in the country. The programme, however, only allocated 877 million euros ($958.47 million) last year out of the 2.9 billion euros' overall budget due to technical and administrative issues, the government said. The remaining funds will be disbursed in new phases and could benefit new contenders, such as Tata.        Discover the latest business news, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

9 lakh govt vehicles older than 15 years to go off road in April,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari has said over nine lakh vehicles, owned by central and state governments, transport corporations and public sector undertakings, will go off the road from April 1.

Addressing an event organised by industry body FICCI, Gadkari said the government is taking many steps to facilitate the use of ethanol, methanol, bio-CNG, bio-LNG and electric vehicles. ""We have now approved the scrapping of more than nine lakh government vehicles, which are more than 15 years old, and polluting buses and cars will go off the road and new vehicles with alternative fuels will replace them. ""This will further reduce air pollution to a great extent,"" the road transport and highway minister said. According to a recent notification by the road transport and highways ministry, from April 1, all vehicles owned by central and state governments, including buses owned by transport corporations and public sector undertakings, that are older than 15 years will be de-registered and scrapped. The rule shall not apply to the special purpose vehicles (armoured and other specialised vehicles) used for operational purposes for the defence of the country and for the maintenance of law and order and internal security, the notification had said. ""Disposal of such vehicles shall, after the expiry of 15 years from the date of the initial registration of the vehicle, (should) be ensured through the Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility set up in accordance with the Motor Vehicles (Registration and Functions of Vehicle Scrapping Facility) Rules, 2021,"" it had said. Announced in the Union Budget 2021-22, the policy provides for fitness tests after 20 years for personal vehicles and 15 years for commercial vehicles. Under the new policy which is effective from April 1, 2022, the Centre has said states and Union Territories will provide up to 25 per cent tax rebate on road tax for vehicles that are purchased after scrapping old vehicles. Last year, Gadkari had said he looked to develop at least one automobile scrapping facility within 150 kilometres from each city centre while asserting that the country has the potential to become a vehicle scrapping hub of the entire South Asian region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the National Vehicle Scrappage Policy in 2021 and said it would help phase out unfit and polluting vehicles and also promote a circular economy. Gadkari said India's target of achieving net zero by 2070 is very much achievable, and if the country follows the strategic and systematic approach towards transportation. ""There is an immediate need to decarbonise the transport sector,"" he emphasised. The minister noted that the need of the hour is to have more buses on electric mode with all the world-class comforts and facilities as it will attract more and more people towards public transport and discourage uses of personal vehicles. According to Gadkari, the logistics costs are 8 to 10 per cent in China , 12 per cent in European countries, 12 per cent in the US and 14-16 per cent in India. ""Our ambition is to bring India's logistics cost to a single digit,"" he said. Pointing out that the share of agriculture and allied sector in India's GDP is only 12 per cent, he said there is need to encourage more investment in agriculture, rural and tribal India. ""If you can increase the contribution of agriculture and allied sectors in India's GDP from 12 per cent to 24 per cent, then it is going to create more jobs in agriculture, and rural areas, and even increasing the agriculture growth  we can make not only smart cities but smart villages also,"" he said.",
Renault to lower its 43% stake in Nissan to 15%,"French automaker Renault has agreed to lower its stake in Nissan Motor to restructure their decades-long alliance, the companies announced in a joint statement on Monday.

The carmakers first signed their coalition in March 1999.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/renault-to-reduce-stake-in-nissan-rebalancing-alliance-nissan-statement-9962171.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"After a nearly twenty four year long alliance French automaker Renault announced its decision to slash its stake in partner Nissan. The deal is aimed at rebalancing the alliance between the two companies, the Japanese firm Nissan said on 30th January. Renault will reduce its stake from 43.4 percent to 15 percent, the same size as Nissan's stake in its French counterpart.Nissan would retain a 15 percent cross-shareholding. Renault holds the larger stake at 43 percent and has voting rights, Nissan makes more cars while owning a 15 percent stake in the French carmaker with no voting rights according to a report by Bloomberg. The two partners have agreed that this rebalancing of stakes would address a power imbalance as the Japanese automaker lacks voting rights. The Japanese automaker is also likely to invest in Renault's electric vehicle business named 'Ampere'. As of now the size of Nissan's probable stake in Ampere is unknown. The alliance formed between Renault and Nissan was joined by Mitsubishi Motors in 2016, when Nissan took a 34 percent stake in its struggling Japanese rival. Mitsubishi Motors Corp also plans to move forward via collaborations on specific projects, including in India, South America and Europe, according to a statement. In November 2022, Renault announced that it would split its operations in two -- its new venture Ampere, and a separate subsidiary for petrol, diesel and hybrid cars that will pair up with China's Geely. The French maker of Megane E-Tech and Austral cars wants to deepen ties with partners such as Chinas Zhejiang Geely Holding Co. and chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. After the deal, the French automaker will not immediately sell the outstanding 28.4 percent of its Nissan shares because the current market value is lower than that registered in Renault's accounts, instead, the shares will be placed in a trust for sale when prices improve a report by Bloomberg said.",

The report added that the company is conducting a third party independent forensic audit and for the same it has hired audit firm KPMG. Moreover, the company recently announced an increase in prices of its vehicles across models by about 1.1 per cent. This was the second price hike that the carmaker undertook in the ongoing fiscal year, after increasing it in April 2022. In December last year, the company had said it would hike prices of its vehicles to offset the impact of rising input costs and make provisions to update the model range to conform to stricter emission norms which will kick in from April 2023.

Whole scope of electric vehicle mobility highly overrated: KTM CEO,KTM owner Pierer Mobility's CEO Stefan Pierer feels the whole scope of the concept of electric vehicle mobility is highly overrated. It isn't feasible for high-powered bikes to run on electric engines because the battery's weight required to generate equivalent power of a gasoline engine would be too high. He added it isn't easy to convince politicians about the impracticality.,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ktm-boss-says-scope-of-electric-mobility-highly-overrated-9912841.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The head of Swiss sports bike maker KTM, which claims to be the world's No 1 premium motorbike brand and also sells tens of hundreds of e-bikes in Europe, is not confident of the capability of electric vehicles beyond a point and feels that optimism on this front is ""highly overrated"". KTM, which is primarily into high-end racing bikes, has a 50.1:49.9 manufacturing JV with Bajaj Auto. It will also be selling the electric model of the resurrected iconic Chetak scooters from the Bajaj stable in Europe from the first quarter of 2024. ""The whole scope and capability of the concept of electric vehicle mobility is highly overrated. It's the result of mixing the laws of physics incorrectly and also by mis-reading the laws of energy,"" Stefan Pierer, the chief executive of Pierer Mobility that owns the KTM brand, told a select group of journalists at a media roundtable here. ""I know it isn't easy to tell and convince the politicians about the sheer impracticality of attempting to make high-end EV bikes,"" he said, adding it needs 10x more storage space in the EV segment to generate energy that one litre of gasoline can produce. For a bike, which is a highly space crunched product, how can one expect it to carry 600-700 kg of batteries, he wondered. For the same reason, he said, it is not possible for sports or high-end bikes to run on electricity. It is not feasible for high-powered bikes to run on electric engines. This is because the weight of the battery required to generate equivalent power of a gasoline engine would be too high, he pointed out. Another factor capping the scope of EVs is the exorbitantly high cost of battery components. Prices of lithium-ion battery components have soared five-six times in the recent past as a result of the higher demand and government push to switch to electric mobility. But it is not easy to drive these points to politicians, he remarked. However, Pierer was quick to admit that EVs as a tool for urban/city mobility is easily doable and will continue to grow and that is the reason why the company also makes low-end bikes for the segment. On launch of the e-Chetak from Bajaj Auto in Europe from 2024, he said the scooter is a great product, especially its second version, and such vehicles which are purely for city commute stand to gain from the EV push. The e-Chetak, especially the second generation, is a great commuter product for a market like Europe. If everything goes as planned we should be selling this e-scooter in Europe from early 2024, he added. Pierer was speaking to reporters here last Friday when the JV plant rolled out the 1 millionth KTM bike from the Chakan plant. The Bajaj KTM tie-up began in October 2007 and the first bike was rolled out in 2011. The company makes lower-capacity KTMs and the sub-400 cc Husqvarna models at the Chakan unit. The KTM-Bajaj partnership may explore bringing in more mid-range models in the 600-690 cc range, Pierer said. The Chetak, named after the legendary horse of the great warrior Maharana Pratap, was produced from 1972 onwards. It had a waiting period of up to 10 years in 1980s. Bajaj sold over 5,00,000 units by 1983, and around 100 million units by 1995. But by 2004, the company under the present management led by Rajiv Bajaj discontinued the Chetak. The iconic scooter, that was a household name, made a comeback in October 2019 in the EV form and since then has sold around 25,000 units at price tag of Rs 1.4 lakh. Bajaj Auto's wholly-owned subsidiary, Chetak Technology, has set up an electric vehicle plant in Akurdi, near Pune. Bajaj had acquired a 14.5 per cent stake in the Austrian bike maker in 2007. Over the years, Bajaj's stake has grown to 49.9 per cent in KTM's parent company Pierer AG.",

The carmaker has big plans to cement its presence in the EV segment with 10 new electric models by March 2026. It already commands bulk of the share of the EV segment in India. The report added that the company has reached out to several marquee investors, impact funds, sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, Korea and Singapore, as well as Canadian pension funds. ""The transition to electric mobility in India will happen much faster than we are imagining. We are confident that we chose the right strategy,"" N Chandrasekaran, Tata Motors' chairman, had said during the recently held Auto Expo. The company showcased 12 cars, including five electric models, and 14 trucks, including ones powered by hydrogen fuel cells, as it looks to deepen its clean vehicle push. The cars included electric versions of its popular Harrier and Sierra SUVs as well as a concept car based on its new electric vehicle platform which is expected to be launched in late 2025, Chandra said. Tata Motors enjoys an early mover advantage in the Indian EV market. Its rivals are fast catching up with a slew of EV launches seen recently at the auto expo. The government wants to grow electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030. The carmaker will also offer a choice of ranges for its EVs so it can address the needs of multiple buyers, including shorter ranges for city use, Shailesh Chandra, managing director of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and its EV subsidiary told Reuters on the sidelines of India's Auto Expo car show.",
